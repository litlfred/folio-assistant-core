/**
 * A reviewer's VERDICT on one version of one block: "I read this, and here is
 * my judgement". Bean `px0t`, epic `q4jm`.
 *
 * @module folio-assistant-core/schemas/review-verdict
 * @graphNode schema
 *
 * ## Why this exists
 *
 * `content-change-review.bpmn`'s coverage gate (`GW_Covered`) asks whether
 * every changed block has been reviewed. Review COMMENTS cannot answer that:
 * a block with no comments may be unread or may be fine, and a block whose
 * comments are all resolved has had its questions answered, not its content
 * judged. Only a record of the judgement answers it.
 *
 * ## The write channel: a tagged PR comment (owner, 2026-09-23)
 *
 * Asked how a reviewer records one, the owner chose option 1: the same
 * channel as a review comment, so nothing new has to be learned or installed.
 *
 * ```
 * block: prose:dose prose:schedule
 * verdict: ok
 * role: clinical-sme
 * ```
 *
 * - `verdict: ok`: read, no objection.
 * - `verdict: changes`: read, and it needs changing. The reasons are review
 *   COMMENTS (kind `defect` or `suggestion`); the verdict only says the block
 *   was read.
 * - `waive: <reason>`: the block needs no review, for example a pure rename.
 *   The reason is required, and is kept.
 *
 * `block:` may name several labels, so a reviewer finishing a slice can say
 * so in one comment. One verdict is recorded per label.
 *
 * ## Pages and inputs: what no block reaches (bean `bnjs`)
 *
 * A rendered page that no changed block reaches has no block to give a
 * verdict on: a page changed by a manifest or a media file, the comment
 * pages, every page of a FHIR IG. Neither has an input a renderer could not
 * place. The same tag takes them:
 *
 * ```
 * page: dpi-h-ra/index.html ast/artifact/PlanDefinition-X.html
 * verdict: ok
 * ```
 *
 * ```
 * input: sushi-config.yaml
 * waive: only the version string changed
 * ```
 *
 * `page:` names a path in the staging build's `rendered-impact.json` (or a
 * page the build measured and the prediction missed); `input:` names one of
 * its undetermined inputs. Each is pinned to that file's `hash` there, the
 * blobs of the inputs that reach it, so it counts only while those inputs
 * stay as they were reviewed. `block:`, `page:` and `input:` may be combined.
 *
 * **A comment is either a verdict or a review comment, never both.** A tag
 * carrying `kind:` as well as `verdict:` or `waive:` is refused, so one
 * comment cannot be counted twice under two meanings.
 *
 * ## A verdict is pinned to the block's HASH
 *
 * A verdict on the version a reviewer read says nothing about the version
 * that replaced it. {@link computeCoverage} counts a verdict only when its
 * `blockHash` equals the block's current hash. So an edit after review
 * reopens exactly the blocks it touched, and no others.
 *
 * ## Not a todo
 *
 * A review comment is a todo (it asks for something). A verdict asks for
 * nothing; it records that something happened. So it is a plain node in
 * its own declared directory, of graph typology `review-verdicts`, and not a
 * kind whose parent is the todo.
