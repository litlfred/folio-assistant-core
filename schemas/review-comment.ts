/**
 * A reviewer's comment on one block of a folio: a todo with more structure
 * and a closed lifecycle. Bean `423d`, epic `q4jm`.
 *
 * @module folio-assistant-core/schemas/review-comment
 * @graphNode schema
 *
 * ## Why a todo, and why core declares it
 *
 * The owner, 2026-09-23: *"reviewers comment in dynamic KG content.
 * folio-asst-core should declare as special type of todo. more structured."*
 * and *"more restruicted process use"*.
 *
 * So a review comment is a node in the folio's `todos` graph (layer `state`),
 * not a parallel comment store. It is a KIND whose parent is the harness's
 * todo, composed by `nodeKind` (bean `a1lq`). A board, a heat map or a
 * reader that understands todos can therefore read a review comment without
 * knowing this module. Core extends the harness, which is the allowed
 * direction.
 *
 * ## What "more structured" means
 *
 * A general todo may float free of any block; a review comment may not.
 *
 * - `targetLabel` is REQUIRED. The block label is the comment's anchor, and
 *   `id-unique` / `id-stable` (bean `5xzc`) guard it.
 * - `status` is a closed enum, and it moves only through {@link transition}.
 * - Everything specific to review sits under ONE field, `review`, so no
 *   field here can collide with one a parent adds later. That is the
 *   collision `nodeKind` refuses, and one field keeps the surface small.
 *
 * ## The write channel and the canonical record
 *
 * The owner ruled that a reviewer writes a comment as a CONVERSATION COMMENT
 * on the edit-set's pull request, starting with a tag that names the block.
 * That needs nothing installed and sits beside the approve. The review
 * process INGESTS each tagged comment ({@link ingestPrComments}) into one of
 * these, and this is the record the review page and heat map read.
 *
 * Reconciling those two rulings is the agent's reading, and it is recorded
 * as such on bean 423d.
