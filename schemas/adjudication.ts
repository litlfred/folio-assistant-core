/**
 * The adjudication contract — what a judgement is ASKED and what it ANSWERS.
 *
 * Bean `5vo9`. The owner's specification, 2026-09-23:
 *
 * > input = {set of content assets, question/prompt (markdown), list of
 * > judgement codes}, make a judgement, output = {decision-code (dependent on
 * > context), reasoning = markdown}. IO is materialized or by reference. ONLY
 * > agentic/human actor. indicated non-deterministic task/subprocess.
 *
 * ## Why this is in core and the machinery is not
 *
 * The owner's placement ruling, same day: *"contract in core, machinery in
 * cat-harness"*. That is the only split the layers permit, and the reason is
 * declared rather than stylistic: **`folio-assistant-core.json` says
 * `"needs": ["cat-harness"]`** — *"bootstrap, cat harness, fa-core, f-a, from
 * bottom to top"* — so core sits ABOVE the harness. cat-harness cannot import
 * this module; doing so would invert a declared dependency.
 *
 * So the two layers **meet at the data, not at the code**. This module says
 * what a request and an outcome ARE, as documents. The harness reads
 * `<cat-harness.processes:adjudication/>` off a diagram and validates the code against what
 * that diagram declares, the same way `INVOLVEMENT_VOCABULARIES` handles RACI
 * versus RASCI — a vocabulary read from a declaration, never imported from a
 * layer above.
 *
 * The cost that split accepts, stated because it is real: the code enum is
 * written twice, once in a diagram and once in a recorded outcome. The
 * mitigation is {@link AdjudicationOutcomeSchema.codes} — an outcome carries
 * the enum it was adjudicated against, so a consumer COMPARES the two rather than
 * assuming they agree. An outcome that carried only its code would make the
 * divergence undetectable, which is the failure this whole file is shaped
 * against.
 *
 * ## What it does NOT do
 *
 * It does not decide anything, and it cannot. Adjudication is the step entered
 * precisely because no mechanism could settle the question — `adjudication.bpmn`
 * says it of its own adjudicator step: *"the one step nothing here can check: if a
 * mechanism could decide it, the process would not have been entered."* What is
 * checkable is everything AROUND the judgement: that the judge was shown a
 * declared set, that the answer is one of the declared codes, that a reason
 * exists, and that the actor was permitted to adjudicate at all.
 *

/**
 * Who may adjudicate — **the harness's spelling, not a second one.**
 *
 * The owner: *"ONLY agentic human actor."* In this repository's vocabulary
 * that is `person` and `agent`; `system` is the mechanical kind and `external`
 * a participant outside the instance. Both are excluded, and
 * `adjudication.bpmn`'s adjudicator step already says so in the same words —
 * `<cat-harness.processes:fulfilment kinds="person agent"/>`, whose reason reads *"a
 * mechanical system may NOT take this step, which is the whole reason the
 * process exists."*
 *
 * **These values are copied deliberately rather than renamed**, and the first
 * draft of this file got it wrong: it read `["human", "agentic"]`, which is a
 * SECOND SPELLING of a concept the harness already names. `skill-package.ts`
 * records what that costs — *"It is one vocabulary because it was two, and
 * that is what broke"* — where an LLM agent and a CI runner both recorded
 * `system` and no consumer could tell judgement from a program. The test
 * below caught the repeat, which is why it asserts against the harness's enum
 * instead of restating it.
 *
 * It is a copy rather than an import for the layering reason in the module
 * docstring: core `needs` cat-harness, so importing downward is the one
 * direction available and this is the wrong way round. The test closes the
 * gap a copy leaves.
