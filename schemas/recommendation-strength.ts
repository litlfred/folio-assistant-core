/**
 * Does a `recommendation` block's `strength` resolve? Bean `55ao`.
 *
 * @module folio-assistant-core/schemas/recommendation-strength
 * @graphNode schema
 *
 * The owner, 2026-09-23 (Q2): strength is **a reference to a SKOS vocabulary
 * or value set**, not a closed enum and not free text. WHO's GRADE is not
 * IETF's RFC 2119, so each domain brings its own code list
 * (`folio-code-list/v1`, exported as a SKOS concept scheme), and the check is
 * "resolves in the scheme":
 *
 * - the list is one the folio can see: its own `code-lists/` and every
 *   dependency's, in overlay order (`codeListDirs`);
 * - the code is in that list;
 * - the code is not retired. A retired code stays resolvable for the record,
 *   but is no longer a value an author may choose.
 *
 * A recommendation with NO strength is not a finding here: the field is
 * optional, because some issuing bodies state none. Whether a folio requires
 * one is that folio's rule, not the platform's.
