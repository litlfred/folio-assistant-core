/**
 * Materialising remote content — the three states, and the five gates.
 *
 * @module schemas/materialization
 * @graphNode schema
 *
 * ## One process, and this repository already runs it twice
 *
 * The owner, 2026-09-20:
 *
 * > *"so if large remote collection, and no restrictions known in context, user
 * > can import/maertialize locally. size considerations apply. similar concept
 * > in bootstrapping harness... it is remtoe. content. bootstrape materelaiz
 * > cat-harness locally (or other harness)... similar, should share common
 * > subprocess. also need to know about refreshing amterialed remote content.
 * > general process used everywhere."*
 *
 * | instance | remote source | materialised locally | refresh today |
 * |---|---|---|---|
 * | `who-iris` | IRIS, 361.55 GB | three items under `library/` | nothing |
 * | `bootstrap` | a harness | the `cat-harness` checkout | `upstream-pins.json` + `check:upstream-pins` |
 *
 * The second row is the one that makes this a discovery rather than a design.
 * `bootstrap/processes/initialize-harness.bpmn` fetches a harness that is
 * REMOTE CONTENT and lands it locally; `upstream-pins.json` exists because that
 * local copy goes stale. That is a materialisation and its refresh, built, in
 * production, and named neither.
 *
 * ## Three states — the vocabulary lives in the harness
 *
 * `referenced`, `materialized` and `unknown`, and {@link FixitySchema}, are
 * defined in `cat-harness/schemas/materialization-state.ts` and re-exported
 * here. Bean `tlat` (placement PR5, owner ruling 2, 2026-09-30, option A) moved
 * only that VOCABULARY down; the gates, the purposes and the record that binds
 * them stay in this module, because each gate is a decision about CONTENT. The
 * argument for three states and no default is in that module's doc, with the
 * ruling's addition: a remote-KG subscription is a materialization whose
 * minimum is the chosen subgraphs' metadata under `library/<source>/`.
 *
 * ## The five gates, and why a warning is not a gate
 *
 * Each is a decision a PERSON makes and none is answerable from a file. A gate
 * that only warns is a gate nobody fails, which is the `xom7` shape — a
 * workflow that failed all thirty times it ran with nothing in the repository
 * saying so.
 *
 *   - **size** — what fraction is being taken and what the whole would cost.
 *     361.55 GB is the measured reason the IRIS import is by reference.
 *   - **restrictions** — the owner's phrase is *"no restrictions known in
 *     context"*, and that is a STATE, not a green light. {@link GateVerdict}
 *     has `unknown` for exactly this, and it is never rendered as `permitted`.
 *   - **retention** — what expires this copy. A copy with no expiry cannot be
 *     told from an abandoned one, which is the argument `bean-blocking` already
 *     makes about a block with no expiry.
 *   - **sourceLoss** — what survives if the origin goes. Not hypothetical here:
 *     the one IRIS record this repository holds carries
 *     `http://iris.wpro.who.int/handle/10665.1/14518`, a regional instance that
 *     was merged away. The failure mode is already in the evidence.
 *   - **copyright** — what the licence permits, per bitstream, and whether it
 *     permits the derived work. `LICENSE-CONTENT.md` exists in this repository
 *     and the ingestion pipeline does not read it.
 *
 * ## Two purposes, and they want opposite things
 *
 * The owner, 2026-09-20: *"someone may want the blob/binary/pdf for archival
 * purposes (like a KG version of internet archive/wayback)."*
 *
 * That is not a variant of working materialisation, it is its opposite, and
 * three of the five gates change meaning under it:
 *
 * | | `working` | `archival` |
 * |---|---|---|
 * | what is kept | the DERIVED content — sections, OCR, structure | the ORIGINAL BYTES, unchanged |
 * | retention | expires; the original can be re-fetched | **no expiry, by design** |
 * | `sourceLoss` | unanswered — the derivation is not the source | **discharged** — this copy IS the answer |
 * | fixity | not needed; the derivation is the artefact | **required** — an archive that cannot prove it is unchanged is a copy |
 *
 * So {@link freshness} must not report an archival copy as `no-expiry`, which
 * reads as a finding; for an archive it is the specification. And an archival
 * copy with no {@link Fixity} is not an archive — it is a file somebody kept.
 *
 * **The fixity data already exists.** Every ingested entry's `structure.json`
 * carries `sha256` and `bytes` — `wpr-rdo-2020-003-eng` records
 * `5021518ccd91e26a9533edd8efc643bc24ab7bf2d4eb425c9644967e0bf72842` and
 * 2 810 648 bytes. Nothing reads them as fixity today.
 *
 * **Archival is also the only honest answer to `sourceLoss`.** The one IRIS
 * record this repository holds carries a handle on `iris.wpro.who.int`, a
 * regional instance merged into the global one. A `working` materialisation
 * cannot discharge that gate — the derived sections are not the publication —
 * and saying otherwise is how a repository believes it has a copy it does not.
