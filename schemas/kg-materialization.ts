/**
 * The record of ONE materialised part of a subscribed Knowledge Graph — a
 * subgraph, or a single asset — copied at the subscription's pin. Issue
 * #1719, epic bean `fnx4`, slices 5 and 6 of
 * `cat-harness/docs/proposals/kg-subscriptions.md`.
 *
 * @module schemas/kg-materialization
 * @graphNode schema
 *
 * ## A wrapper around `MaterializationSchema`, not a second one
 *
 * The proposal: *"the state lives on the materialisation record, and the
 * subscription holds only the choice and the pin."* So every part carries a
 * {@link MaterializationSchema} record, unchanged — three states, the five
 * gates, purpose, fixity, expiry — and this file adds only what that record
 * cannot say about itself: WHICH subscription and pin it belongs to, which
 * part of the substrate it is, and, for a subgraph, one record per file.
 *
 * Per-file records are the shape `check:materialized-fixity` already walks
 * (the `sync-remote-skills` precedent), so every held byte is verified by the
 * gate that already exists. The part's own record is a DIRECTORY record for a
 * subgraph — that gate reports it `covered-by-parts` — and carries a tree
 * digest (`treeDigest` in `cat-harness/scripts/kg-subscribe.ts`), which is
 * what catches a file ADDED under the tree, the one edit a per-file check
 * cannot see. `kg:materialize:check` holds that digest.
 *
 * ## A part that stayed referenced still has a record
 *
 * `Process_MaterializeRemote` ends in one of two places, and both write:
 * *"A refusal is written down with the same weight as a success"*. But
 * `MaterializationSchema` forbids gates on anything not materialised —
 * *"a gate verdict on a `referenced` node claims a decision nobody had to
 * make"*. Here somebody DID have to make it, and refused or could not; so the
 * verdicts go in {@link KgRefusalSchema}, beside a `referenced` record rather
 * than inside it. The inner record stays valid, and the decision is not lost.

 *
 * A `materialized` MaterializationSchema record requires all five gates and a

 * schema would mean writing four person-gate answers nobody gave — the
 * fabricated decision `MaterializationSchema` exists to make unrepresentable.
 * So the record carries what is true of it: the pin, the measured `size` gate
 * (kept as a safety cap), and the file's sha256. The `materialization` key is
 * deliberately absent, so `check:materialized-fixity` does not read it as a
 * held artefact; `kg:materialize:check` re-hashes it instead.
