/**
 * `maskedRegions` — the rules, each against the mistake it exists for.
 *
 * A mask is the one declaration in this schema whose failure is INVISIBLE in
 * the artefact it describes: a rectangle that covers less than it claims, or
 * that was measured against a rendering with different dimensions, produces a
 * PNG that looks deliberate either way. Nothing downstream can tell a mask
 * that worked from one that missed, so the checking has to happen here.
 *
 * Fixtures use `state: "referenced"` rather than `"materialized"`. That is not
 * laziness: `materialized` additionally requires `localPath` and all five
 * `gates`, and a first draft of this file used it and got `"state
 * materialized requires all five gates"` back for EVERY case — including the
 * ones expected to pass. Seven refusals in a row read as seven rules working.
 * They were one unrelated rule firing seven times, and the mask rules were
 * never reached at all.
