# folio-assistant-core

**The content layer.** This instance defines what a *folio* is: the
content-object model, the block kinds, the content adapters (`document` and
`paper`) and the profiles nested inside them, and the `folio` graph typology
itself.

## Where it sits

It sits on [C@T Harness](https://github.com/litlfred/folio-assistant/tree/main/cat-harness)
and may import from it. The harness never imports from this layer.
`bun run cat check:partition:edges` reports any edge that runs the wrong way.
Instances such as WHO IRIS sit on top of this one. That is why the navbar
lists it between them, because the order comes from each declaration's
`needs`.

## What it holds

The declaration
[`folio-assistant-core.json`](https://github.com/litlfred/folio-assistant/blob/main/folio-assistant-core/folio-assistant-core.json)
lists every directory and the graph typologies each one holds. The section below is
generated from that declaration. It shows the counts and the viewers that are
published today.

## What a folio is made of here

A folio is a set of content objects. Each object is a file triple: a typed
manifest, a markdown body and, for a formal claim, a Lean sibling. This layer
says which kinds of block exist and what each one must carry. Each kind is
a node in the `block-kinds/` graph with a required profile, so no kind can
go unclassified. The `document` adapter serves structured prose. The `paper`
adapter extends it with the kinds whose assertion is a formal mathematical
claim, typeset through LaTeX.

The rest of the instance supports that model. `validators/` names the checks
the code provides, one node per graph typology and schema family. `glossary/`
holds the content vocabulary. `methodologies/` holds the authoring methods a
folio draws on. `processes/` holds the executable BPMN diagrams for the
authoring and review work. `skills/` holds the instructions an agent loads to
carry that work out.

## The rule this layer turns on

This repository is the platform, not the content. A folio's chapters,
constants and vocabularies live in that folio's own repository. If you are
about to write subject matter here, you are either in the wrong repository or
writing something that belongs in a folio as data.

The instance's
[README](https://github.com/litlfred/folio-assistant/blob/main/folio-assistant-core/README.md)
sets out the scope boundary in full, along with what is still pre-split.
