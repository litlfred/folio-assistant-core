/**
 * `build-glossary.ts` refuses a missing argument with USAGE and exit 2 — not a
 * stack trace.
 *
 * ## The defect, and why the guard could not fire
 *
 * The CLI read its argument as `resolve(positional[0] || "")` and then guarded
 * with `if (!paperDir || !existsSync(paperDir))`. **`resolve("")` returns the
 * current working directory**, which is both truthy and existing, so for the
 * no-argument case the guard was dead code: a bare
 * `bun run build-glossary.ts` fell straight through into `buildGlossary`, which
 * threw `Paper manifest not found: <cwd>/<cwd-basename>.ts` and exited **1**.
 *
 * Measured on this repository before the fix: exit 1 with a stack trace, and the
 * usage line never printed.
 *
 * That is the third-state discipline broken at its cheapest point. Exit 1 says
 * "this went wrong"; exit 2 says "I could not determine what you asked for". A
 * caller — including a Tool node whose contract promises exit 2 — cannot tell a
 * missing argument from a genuinely broken paper if both come back as 1.
 *
 * ## Why this is a spawn test and not a unit test
 *
 * The bug lived in argv handling and process exit, inside `if
 * (import.meta.main)`. Nothing importable was wrong, so no unit test over
 * `buildGlossary` could have caught it — the function behaved correctly on the
 * input it was wrongly given. The observable is the process, so the process is
 * what this runs.
 *
