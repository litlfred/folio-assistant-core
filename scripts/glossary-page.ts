/**
 * The glossary/ page, and the SKOS JSON-LD behind it.
 *
 * Owner, 2026-09-23: *"it should be part of general pracice w/ glossary/ page.
 * check harnesses"*, and *"put glossary into folio-assistant-core"*. So this is
 * core's, and it reads every instance in the repository rather than one:
 *
 * - every `glossary` directory (core's kind): each `*.glossary.json`, validated
 *   as `folio-glossary/v1`, becomes SKOS JSON-LD at
 *   `docs/assets/glossary/<instance>--<scheme>.skos.jsonld` and rows on the page,
 *   where `<instance>` is the instance that OWNS the scheme's sources
 *   ({@link schemeOwner}), not the one declaring the directory;
 * - every `swimlane-glossary` directory (the harness's ledger): counted and
 *   linked to the page that already renders it, never copied, because a
 *   second rendering of the same terms is a second answer free to drift;
 * - every `remoteGraphs` entry with `graphTypologies: ["glossary"]`: an external
 *   SKOS scheme, listed with its link. Referenced, never held;
 * - every KG asset with a title and a description (skills, Tools, BPMN
 *   activities, DMN decisions, documented schema fields), extracted by
 *   `glossary-extract.ts` into one `candidate` scheme per asset type per
 *   instance (bean `lqo9`, piece 1 as posed). Those schemes are GENERATED:
 *   written under core's glossary directory at
 *   `generated/<instance>/<type>.glossary.json`, beside the authored files and
 *   never over them, and the page shows them apart from authored terms.
 *
 * ## Why this, and not a `auto-docs` type
 *
 * The owner framed piece 1 as one `auto-docs` auto-doc-type
 * (`cat-harness/auto-docs/glossary/<path>`), and `gen-auto-docs.ts` has that
 * mechanism. It does not fit what was asked on 2026-09-23 (*"everything
 * extracted to glosasay / skos?"*): a auto-docs type returns `AutoDocItem[]`,
 * one row per artefact FILE for one sub-graph page, and emits no SKOS. The
 * extracted terms are per ELEMENT (one diagram holds dozens of activities),
 * need IRIs in the owning instance's namespace, and must land in the SKOS
 * this page already publishes. `index/skills` and `index/processes` already
 * list the same artefacts per sub-graph, so a auto-docs glossary type over
 * them would be a third rendering. The existing auto-docs `glossary` type
 * stays what it is: the swimlane ledger per sub-graph, linked from here.
 *
 * ## One index, one page per asset type
 *
 * Owner, 2026-09-24: *"Split per asset type"*. Extraction took the one page
 * from 9 KB to 1.4 MB. `glossary/` is now the index (authored terms, counts,
 * sources, and a link to every asset type's page) and `glossary/<type>/`
 * holds that type's extracted candidates from every instance. A term is on
 * exactly one page, and each page has a size budget ({@link PAGE_BUDGET})
 * that it states and `--check` enforces. The SKOS files are unchanged.
 *
 * `--check` writes nothing and fails when a document does not validate, the
 * committed output is stale, or a page is over its budget. That is
 * `check:glossary`, and it is a gate.
 *
 * Search: the page carries a filter box over its own terms, and the site's
 * search indexes the page like any other. A cross-instance search index is
 * bean `4pm8`'s and not built here.
 *
 * Usage:  bun run folio-assistant-core/scripts/glossary-page.ts [--check]
 *
 * @module folio-assistant-core/scripts/glossary-page
 * @covers glossary, swimlane-glossary, docs — it reads every instance's glossary
 *   directory and links the harness's ledger without copying it

 * have no way to tell which was right. So it calls the gate's `run` and

 *
 * Until 2026-10-01 this read `cat-harness/test/results/term-mapping.qa-results.json`.
 * QA results leave `main` for the `qa-reports` branch (owner rulings D1/D4),

 * checked" on six glossary pages and `check:glossary` failed on all six. A
 * committed page cannot depend on a file that is not committed, and reading
 * the branch from a page renderer would make `glossary:page` a network call.
 * The computation is offline (`check-term-mapping`'s FHIR snapshot is pinned
 * in the checkout), so computing it is both possible and cheaper than
 * fetching it.
 *
 * **`undefined` still means "could not determine"**, and the page then says
 * the check has not run: no `cat-harness` instance to compute from, or a run
 * that threw. Rendering "0 mapped" over that would be `dh4f` exactly. A run

<tbody>
<tr><td>authored</td><td>A person wrote or approved the definition.</td><td>${n.authored}</td></tr>
<tr><td>candidate, extracted</td><td>Lifted from a knowledge-graph asset's own title and description, verbatim, and not curated.

## Already somebody else's concept?

Extracted candidates are minted from this repository's own assets and are not, by themselves, checked against any vocabulary. \`check:term-mapping\` asks whether each already exists as a concept somebody is authoritative for — SKOS for what a term MEANS, FHIR for a clinical code's operational semantics — and the two are separate questions with separate answers.

${mappingBlock(mappingStates(), [...new Set(c.glossaries.map((g) => g.glossary.id))])}

## Pages

Each term is on exactly one page. Extracted candidates are split by asset type, so that no page is fetched at the size of all of them (owner, 2026-09-24).

${pagesTable(size)}

**Size:** this page holds ${rows.length} terms and is ${size} before compression, within its budget of ${sizeLabel(PAGE_BUDGET.index)}; each asset type's page has a budget of ${sizeLabel(PAGE_BUDGET.type)}. There is no search index: the filter on each page runs over that page, and its A–Z bar jumps within it. The SKOS files in the sources are the machine-readable form.

## Authored terms

${ordered.length ? `${ordered.map(orderedBlock).join("\n\n")}\n\n### Every other authored term, A–Z\n\n` : ""}${termsBlock(rows.filter((r) => !r.s.glossary.ordered))}

## Sources

### Authored

<ul>
${sources.join("\n")}
</ul>

### Extracted from knowledge-graph assets

Generated by \`folio-assistant-core/scripts/glossary-extract.ts\` into \`${esc(relative(REPO, generatedDir()).split("\\").join("/"))}/<instance>/<type>.glossary.json\`, one scheme per asset type per instance, each term's IRI in the namespace of the instance that holds the asset. BPMN lanes and roles are not extracted again: the ${ledgerTerms} swimlane-role terms above already carry them, with every lane name as an alternative label.
