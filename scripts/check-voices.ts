/**
 * Validate the voice graph — and, above all, that every rule cites something.
 *
 * `loadVoices` already refuses a malformed profile, so this adds the checks a
 * Zod schema cannot make: that a cited `library/` section EXISTS on disk, that a
 * cited KG node exists, and that the quote is long enough to be a quote.
 *
 * The defect it exists to make impossible is PR #210's: three WHO voice profiles
 * with ten plausible rules each and `source: null`. Plausible is not right — its
 * first rule asserted `-ise/-isation` as WHO's spelling baseline, and the WHO
 * Editorial Style Manual says "`-ize` … is preferred" on page 14. Nothing in a
 * type system catches a confident invention; a resolvable citation does.

 *
 * ## A vendor voice must SPECIALISE a voice that resolves
 *
 * `voice-vendors` (bean `rkqp`) holds a base voice specialised for one agent
 * vendor: `folio-voice/v1` with `extends` naming the base. The citation checks
 * below read those files like any other voice, and say nothing about the one
 * property that makes them vendor voices — so a vendor voice with no `extends`
 * (a base voice filed in the wrong place) or one whose `extends` names a voice
 * no instance ships, or that cycles, passed. `resolveVoice` reports both
 * failures and had no caller in a gate: `skill-voice-review.ts` skips an
 * unresolvable chain on the stated ground that *"`check:voices` owns"* it,
 * which this file did not do until PR #2094. See {@link vendorVoiceFindings}.
