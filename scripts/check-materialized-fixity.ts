/**
 * Materialized content is READ-ONLY, and this is what enforces it.
 *
 * @module folio-assistant-core/scripts/check-materialized-fixity
 * @covers computed — it follows every node whose `materialization.state` is `materialized`,
 *   which is a property of NODES rather than of kinds
 *
 * ## The rule, in the owner's words
 *
 * 2026-09-21: *"if we have a mateiralized `<stub>/<sub-graph>`, the contents
 * of it should be immutable (expect for publication worfklow purposes or so)
 * … you would need to copy/mateiralize it to your own `folio/` in order to
 * mess around with it."*
 *
 * And 2026-09-22, choosing between advising and enforcing: **enforce from the
 * start.**
 *
 * ## Why editing in place is a defect rather than a mess
 *
 * A `materialized` node is a copy of somebody else's artefact. who-iris's
 * catalogue asserts *this is what IRIS holds*. Edit one of those bytes in
 * place and the assertion is false for that item while
 * `materialization.state` still reads `materialized` — a claim that outlives
 * the thing it described, which is the failure this repository keeps meeting
 * in other costumes.
 *
 * ## The mechanism was already here and nothing read it
 *
 * `schemas/materialization.ts` says so in as many words: *"The fixity data
 * already exists. Every ingested entry's `structure.json` carries `sha256` and
 * `bytes` … **Nothing reads them as fixity today.**"*
 *
 * So enforcement needs no new metadata and — importantly — no attribution of
 * a commit to a process step. It asks a question about BYTES: does this file
 * still hash to what its record says? A check that tried instead to decide
 * *who* wrote and *under which task* would need every writer to announce
 * itself, and would pass for anyone who forgot to.
 *
 * ## How the publication exception works, without being a carve-out
 *
 * The owner's exception — *"expect for publication worfklow purposes or so"* —
 * needs no special case here, and that is the design rather than a shortcut.
 *
 * A publication step that legitimately rewrites a materialized artefact
 * (signing, stamping, versioning) **updates the fixity in the same change**.
 * The check then passes, and the record now describes what is actually there.
 * A step that rewrites without updating fixity fails — correctly, because it
 * has forked the upstream without saying so, which is precisely what the rule
 * exists to prevent.
 *
 * In other words the exception is not "these actors may skip the rule"; it is
 * **"say what you did"**. That is checkable, where a list of permitted writers
 * is a list that goes stale the first time somebody adds a sixth one.
 *
 * ## The third state is a finding, not a pass
 *
 * A materialized artefact with **no** fixity cannot be verified, and
 * `materialization.ts` is explicit that *"an archival copy with no Fixity is
 * not an archive — it is a file somebody kept"*. So it is reported, and it is
 * reported SEPARATELY from a mismatch: one says the bytes changed, the other
 * says nobody can tell. Collapsing them would let an unverifiable artefact
 * read as a verified one.
 *
 * Usage:
 *   bun run cat-harness/scripts/check-materialized-fixity.ts
 *   bun run cat-harness/scripts/check-materialized-fixity.ts --json
