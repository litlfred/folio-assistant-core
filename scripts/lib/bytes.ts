/**
 * Where a catalogue bitstream's bytes are.
 *
 * @module folio-assistant-core/scripts/lib/bytes
 *
 * **Moved from `who-iris/scripts/lib/` on 2026-09-30 (bean `eayu`).** Owner:
 * *"dspace scripts generic in folio-assistant"*. Nothing here is IRIS's: a
 * `localPath` is instance-relative for EVERY catalogue instance, so the
 * instance directory is now a parameter rather than `import.meta.dir/../..`,
 * which could only ever name who-iris.
 *
 * **This was the `yl5w` workaround, and `yl5w` is settled.** Every `localPath`
 * on an ORIGINAL bitstream pointed at `who-iris/uploads/…` while the bytes sat
 * in `cat-harness/uploads/` — #477 moved `library/` and left the sources
 * behind — so this module resolved the declared path first and fell back to
 * the real location. Two consumers needed it: the page generator, to emit a
 * link that works, and the cover renderer, to have something to render.
 *
 * 2026-09-21 the owner ruled that a folio's sources live in the folio. The
 * three PDFs were `git mv`-ed to `who-iris/uploads/<slug>/`, beside each item's
 * own `intake.json` and IRIS capture, and `check:catalogue` now verifies every
 * `localPath`. **So the fallback is gone rather than left in place**, and that
 * is what the old note promised: the declared path was already tried first, so
 * settling the bean was a deletion rather than a rewrite.
 *
 * What survives is the resolver itself, because the two consumers still need
 * one answer rather than two — and because `undefined` is a real outcome. A
 * node may name no `localPath` at all, and **that is not the same as naming one
 * that is missing**: the first is a bitstream this repository does not hold,
 * the second is a claim that failed, and `check:catalogue` is what reports the
 * second. A generator that conflated them would print "no asset" over a defect.

/**

 * Instance-relative, per `MaterializationSchema.localPath`: *"where the bytes
 * landed, instance-relative"*. Searching elsewhere is what the removed
 * fallback did, and it is precisely what made the contract unenforceable —
 * a resolver that finds the file one instance over reports a false claim as
 * true, which is the defect `yl5w` was opened for.
 *
 * `instanceDir` is the catalogue instance's root, the directory holding its
 * `<name>.json`. `name` is no longer read. It stays in the signature because
 * callers pass it and it is what a future fixity check would compare against;
 * drop it only alongside them.
