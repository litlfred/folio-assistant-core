/**
 * `codemod-refterm.ts` refuses a missing argument with USAGE and exit 2 — not a
 * stack trace.
 *
 * ## The same defect as `build-glossary.ts`, found eight days later
 *
 * The CLI read its argument as `resolve(positional[0] || "")` and then guarded
 * with `if (!target || !existsSync(target))`. **`resolve("")` returns the
 * current working directory**, which is both truthy and existing, so for the
 * no-argument case the guard was dead code: a bare
 * `bun run codemod-refterm.ts` fell straight through into `resolveChapters`,
 * which threw `Manifest not found: <cwd>/<cwd-basename>.ts` and exited with a
 * stack trace.
 *
 * Measured on this repository before the fix, 2026-09-30: the usage line never
 * printed.
 *
 * Bean `1oqu` fixed the identical shape in `build-glossary.ts` and
 * `build-glossary-usage.test.ts` pinned it. This file is that test's twin, and
 * the duplication is deliberate: the observable is a process, so there is
 * nothing importable to share, and a test that covered both through one helper
 * would pass while either script regressed alone.
 *
 * ## Why the second instance survived the first fix
 *
 * These two scripts sat in different directories — `content/pipeline/` and
 * `scripts/tests/` — until bean `yj6r` moved both into
 * `folio-assistant-core/scripts/` for the instance-boundary work. **Being
 * adjacent is what made the second one visible**, and it was found by reading
 * the neighbour rather than by any check. Nothing in the gate set asks whether
 * a CLI refuses a missing argument, which is why one fix did not imply the
 * other.
 *
 * ## The third-state discipline, at its cheapest point
 *
 * Exit 1 says "this went wrong". Exit 2 says "I could not determine what you
 * asked for". A caller — including a Tool node whose contract promises exit 2 —
 * cannot tell a missing argument from a genuinely broken paper if both come
 * back as 1.
