/**
 * review-comment-move — a review-process task moves one review comment's
 * status, and the move is COMMITTED to the folio's todos graph on the
 * edit-set's FEATURE BRANCH. Bean `423d`.
 *
 * ## The owner's ruling, 2026-09-23
 *
 * Asked where a status change is saved, the owner chose option 1 of three:
 * the task that moves a status commits the comment into the folio's `todos/`.
 * Then, sharpened: *"more accurate.. commit to feature branch"*. The commit
 * goes to the FEATURE BRANCH that carries the edit-set, the branch the edits
 * themselves are committed to, never to `main`. So the change is:
 * - on the same branch as the edit it is about, and reviewed with it;
 * - landed on `main` only when that branch is merged, as the review record;
 * - part of the dynamic KG.
 *
 * `--commit` enforces the branch. It refuses a detached HEAD and the base
 * branch (default `main`), because a status committed straight to `main`
 * would record a review outcome that no merge ever accepted.
 *
 * Rejected: the published file only (not reviewed, not in the KG, lost with
 * the preview), and `main` after merge (nothing durable during the review).
 *
 * ## Where the file goes: the graph says, not this script
 *
 * The directory is the todos graph's node of kind `todo-feedback`, which
 * `todos.json` declares as "todos raised against a specific block, carrying
 * the submitter's identity". That is exactly a review comment. It is read
 * from the declaration, never assumed. A folio whose todos graph declares no
 * such node gets an error naming the remedy, not a file written somewhere
 * nobody scans.
 *
 * ## The file is the node, as JSON
 *
 * `<feedback dir>/<id>.json`: one `review-comment/1.0.0` node, the same
 * object `review-comments.json` carries. It is not Markdown, because the
 * todo reader's front-matter parser is flat and a review comment carries a
 * nested `review` field. One format for the kind, wherever it is stored.
 *
 * ## Only the process moves it
 *
 * Every move goes through `transition()`, which refuses anything not in
 * `REVIEW_TRANSITIONS` for the named process task. So this command is not a
 * back door: `--process` and `--task` must be a task allowed to make that
 * move, and closing a comment still needs `--decision`.
