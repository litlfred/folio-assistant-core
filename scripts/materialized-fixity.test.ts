/**
 * Materialized content is read-only, and fixity is what says so.
 *
 * Owner, 2026-09-21: *"if we have a mateiralized `<stub>/<sub-graph>`, the
 * contents of it should be immutable … you would need to copy/mateiralize it
 * to your own `folio/` in order to mess around with it."* And 2026-09-22,
 * choosing between advising and enforcing: **enforce from the start.**
 *
 * ## The four verdicts are four different facts
 *
 * Every assertion here is about keeping them apart, because each collapse has
 * already happened once:
 *
 * - **verified** vs **unverifiable** — `materialization.ts` says an archival
 *   copy with no fixity *"is not an archive, it is a file somebody kept"*.
 *   Reporting one as the other turns "nobody can check this" into "this is
 *   unchanged".
 * - **absent** vs **unverifiable** — the first version of `verify()` asked
 *   about the digest before asking whether the bytes existed, so two
 *   smart-immunizations artefacts that are declared materialized **with no
 *   file at all** were filed as "no fixity digest recorded", beside 217 that
 *   are merely unverified. A broken claim hid inside a softer category.
 * - **covered-by-parts** vs **unverifiable** — who-iris's items point at a
 *   DIRECTORY (`library/<id>`) while their bitstreams point at
 *   `uploads/<id>/<file>`. A file digest cannot apply to a directory, so the
 *   item read as a gap while every byte under it was verified by its parts.
 *   The same defect as `harness-tiles` reporting a viewer nobody had built,
 *   one layer along.
