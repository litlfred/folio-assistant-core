/**
 * Subprocess descent, walked over a real decomposed process —
 * `l1-document-ingestion.bpmn` and its four `ingest-*` phases.
 *
 * Before descent, a `callActivity` was an opaque box the caller completed in
 * one step, which meant a decomposed diagram was strictly WORSE than a flat
 * one: it read better and gated less. These tests pin the opposite property —
 * that decomposing a process moves its steps into a child rather than deleting
 * them.
 *
 * MOVED HERE from `cat-harness/scripts/tests/workflow-subprocess.test.ts` in
 * placement PR6 (bean `apcg`), with the process it walks: the pipeline was
 * `document-ingestion.bpmn`'s body and is core's `l1-document-ingestion.bpmn`
 * now, while the harness diagram became the basic flow this one calls first.
 * The engine is still the harness's; importing it from here is a downward
 * edge. The fixture-only cases stayed in the harness file.

 * These tests ran `complete(…, "Task_Detect")` directly, because `Task_Detect`
 * was the first activity. It is not any more: `Task_Place` was inserted ahead
 * of it on 2026-09-30, so the engine correctly refused with *"Task_Detect is
 * not enabled … Enabled now: Task_Place"* and six tests went red at once.
 *
 * The prefix is walked rather than named, so the next step inserted ahead of
 * the phase moves these tests instead of breaking them. It is **bounded and it
 * refuses**: a diagram that never reaches `CallActivity_Extract`, or that puts
 * a decision in front of it, fails here with a message about the diagram
 * rather than looping or silently asserting less. Nothing is skipped — the
 * property each test pins is unchanged, and only the walk to the subject is.
