/**
 * The content half of the document adapter imports nothing that moves to
 * `cat-harness-tools` (bean `w2gr`, step 2).
 *
 * Ruling C1 (2026-10-01, later the same day) put `cat-harness-tools` BELOW core,
 * so the rule this test keeps is now "core must not depend on the MCP server".
 * It was first written against the earlier ruling, that `folio-assistant-core`
 * does not depend on
 * `cat-harness-tools`, where the MCP server, the HTTP routes and RBAC are
 * moving. So the document adapter was cut in two: `content.ts` is what a
 * document folio IS, and `index.ts` is the server wrapper step 3 moves out.
 * This test is what keeps the cut honest — a content file that reaches for
 * `Request`, a tool registrar or the RBAC module fails here, before step 3
 * turns that reach into a dependency the ruling forbids.
 *
 * The moving set is the w2gr classification: the server entry points, the
 * tool and route modules, RBAC and GitHub auth, the auth gateway, the MCP
 * project, and the MCP server adapter. `core/{git,feedback,cache,logging,
 * anthropic}` STAY — they import nothing from the server.
