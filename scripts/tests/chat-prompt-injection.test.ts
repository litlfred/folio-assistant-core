/**
 * Untrusted text must not be able to close the fence it sits inside.
 *
 * Bean `1wef`, surface 3. `getChatSystemPrompt` composes a **system prompt**
 * from request-supplied context, and `context.blockMd` is FOLIO CONTENT —
 * which for an ingested corpus (`uploads/`, the IRIS catalogue, the 674
 * smart-trust artefacts) this repository did not author.
 *
 * It was fenced with a fixed `"""`. Content carrying `"""` closed it, and
 * everything after sat OUTSIDE the quoted region, where a model reads it as
 * instruction rather than as the document under discussion. Demonstrated
 * 2026-09-22: a hostile block produced a prompt with four fences, not two.
 *
 * **All three surfaces of `1wef` are one bug** — content closing a delimiter
 * it was meant to sit inside. Surface 1 was a shell quote, surface 2 an
 * `innerHTML` sink, this one a prompt fence.
