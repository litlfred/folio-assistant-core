/**
 * Pipeline scripts must be findable from a folio that does not vendor them.
 *
 * `runPipeline` resolved `content/pipeline/<script>.ts` against the FOLIO
 * only. That directory exists in the `qou` layout, where the platform was
 * vendored inside the content repo, and does not exist in anything
 * `folio_init` scaffolds. So roughly twenty-five tools — the whole QA, audit,
 * bibliography and transform surface — returned `pipeline script not found` on
 * every scaffolded folio.
 *
 * Unlike the sibling defect in `content_validate` (which reported a clean run
 * having executed nothing), this one was at least honest. But honest and inert
 * is still inert, and the fix is the same fallback.
