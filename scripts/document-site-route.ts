/**
 * Where a document folio's site puts its PAGES and its DATA: one answer, used
 * by the site's builders and by the rendered-impact predictor (issue #2527).
 *
 * A page is under the page locale, `en/…`, as every visualiser page is
 * (`PAGE_LOCALE`, `cat-harness-tools/scripts/viewer-declarations.ts`). The
 * pages' chrome is English, so English is the one locale they are written in.
 *
 * Data a page loads stays where it was, so an address a script or another
 * site already reads still answers: a lazy page's `<slug>/blocks/NNN.json`,
 * its comment notes `<slug>/pc-notes.json`, a library entry's
 * `entries/<id>.doc.json`, the dashboard's `comments.json`, and the site's
 * `outline.json`. The landing `index.html` stays at the site root, which is
 * where a reader arrives.
 *
 * A document's images move WITH its page, to `en/<slug>/media/`: its blocks
 * link them relative to the page (`media/<file>`), and the page is what they
 * belong to.
 *
 * Every path here is site-relative, `/`-separated, with no leading slash.
