/**
 * MATERIALISE one chosen part of a subscribed Knowledge Graph — a subgraph,
 * or a single asset — at the subscription's pin, through the five gates of
 * `Process_MaterializeRemote`, and record what was decided.
 *
 * @module folio-assistant-core/scripts/kg-materialize
 * @covers substrate-snapshot — the parts each subscription holds, under its snapshot directory
 *
 * Issue #1719, epic bean `fnx4`, slices 5 and 6 of
 * `cat-harness/docs/proposals/kg-subscriptions.md`. Slice 4 (`kg:subscribe`)
 * wrote the choice and the pin; this is the verb that makes bytes arrive.
 *
 * ## Why it lives in core, not beside `kg-subscribe.ts`
 *
 * The record it writes embeds `MaterializationSchema`, which is core's, and
 * cat-harness needs only bootstrap: a writer in `cat-harness/scripts/` would
 * import up the dependency arrow, the edge `check:partition` fails on and the
 * one bean `bf5l` removed from `intake.ts`. Core needs cat-harness, so from
 * here both halves are reachable and both edges point down. The precedent is
 * `sample-import-run.ts`, which drives a large-datasets process from here.
 * The LAYOUT and a structural reader stay in cat-harness
 * (`partDirOf`, `treeDigest`, `partRecordsIn`), so the subscriptions page
 * draws a record without importing this file.
 *
 * ## `sync-remote-skills`, generalised
 *
 * The same three moves: pin a 40-character SHA, write the bytes as they were,
 * record a sha256 per file. Two things are added, because a subgraph is not
 * a skill package:
 *
 * - **The five gates.** A skill sync answers none of them; a subscription may
 *   reach any substrate, so every copy goes through the process the owner
 *   asked to be shared (*"should share common subprocess"*). `size` is
 *   MEASURED, against `maxBytes`; the other four are a person's, read from a
 *   decisions file ({@link KgDecisionsSchema}). A gate the file does not
 *   answer is `unknown`, and `unknown` on any gate keeps the part
 *   referenced — `Gateway_Gates`: *"An unanswered gate counts as a refusal."*
 * - **A tree digest**, so a file ADDED under a held subgraph is caught, the
 *   one edit `check:materialized-fixity`'s per-file walk cannot see.
 *
 * ## What it refuses before any byte moves, and says why
 *
 * - a subscription that does not exist, or whose snapshot is missing or at
 *   another pin (re-subscribe first);
 * - a subgraph the subscription did not CHOOSE (`subgraphs`), or that the
 *   cached snapshot does not DECLARE — the two are separate refusals, because
 *   their remedies are different people's;
 * - an asset when the asset policy is not `on-demand` or `all`, or whose path
 *   lies outside every directory the snapshot declares;
 * - a held part at a different pin: moving it is `refresh-materialized`.
 *
 * ## Four outcomes, and could-not-determine is never one of the clean ones
 *
 * `materialized` (bytes plus record), `stayed-referenced` (a record that says
 * which gate stopped it, so the next caller does not re-litigate it),
 * `refused` (no record: the request itself was not valid), and
 * `could-not-determine` (the fetch failed: NOTHING is written, because a
 * record would claim a fact about bytes nobody read).
 *
 * ## The fetch
 *
 * Shallow, blobless, one commit; then a no-cone SPARSE checkout of exactly the
 * part's path and the root licence, so only those blobs arrive. Injectable
 * ({@link PartFetcher}), so every judgement is tested over fixtures. The
 * bytes land in a temporary directory first: measuring is not materialising,
 * and nothing under the instance changes unless all five gates pass.
 *
 * ## Metadata mode — `--nodes <subscription> <subgraph-path>` (bean `c1m4`)
 *
 * Owner ruling 2026-10-03: *"add a metadata mode"*. It fetches ONE file, the
 * subgraph's published `index.hydrated.jsonld` (`kg-export.md` §"Named
 * subgraphs"), so "every node of `skills/sdlc`" arrives as graph metadata
 * without a byte of the subgraph itself. The byte copy above and its five
 * gates are unchanged; this is a second verb beside it, not a branch inside it.
 *
 * - **Where.** `<docs>/subgraph/<HARNESS>/<path>/index.hydrated.jsonld` in the
 *   subscribed repository, at the pin. `<docs>` is the snapshot's declared
 *   `docs` directory and `<HARNESS>` the snapshot's declaration name — read
 *   from the cached declaration, the way `gen-subgraph-jsonld` reads its own,
 *   never spelled. Fetched through the same injectable {@link PartFetcher}, so
 *   the pin check (`FETCH_HEAD` must be the pinned SHA) is the same code.
 * - **The root is refused, by design.** A harness root publishes
 *   `index.jsonld` only: a deep hydrated file there is the monolith `f233`
 *   forbids. A root request is REFUSED with a pointer at `index.jsonld`; it is
 *   never read as an empty subgraph.
 * - **Validated before it lands.** `SubgraphHydratedSchema`, and the root
 *   `@id` must be the subgraph asked for (`…/subgraph/<HARNESS>/<path>/`), so a
 *   file published under the wrong path cannot be held as the right one.
 * - **Held** at `<snapshot dir>/<subscription>/nodes/<path>/` (`nodesDirOf`),
 *   the file plus a `nodes.json` record (`KgNodesRecordSchema`) carrying its
 *   sha256, which `--check` re-hashes offline.
 * - **The same four outcomes.** `materialized`; `stayed-referenced` when the
 *   size cap stops it (a record saying so, no file); `refused` for a request
 *   or a file that is not valid — no record; `could-not-determine` when the
 *   fetch failed — NOTHING written.
 *
 * **The gates, decided: only `size` applies, and it applies as a cap.** The
 * four person gates exist because a copy of somebody else's CONTENT can carry
 * a licence, a restriction, a retention duty, or be the last copy there is.
 * This file is none of those. It is a description of content — node ids,
 * types, labels, links — that the substrate itself PUBLISHES on its site for
 * anyone to read, and every heavy body in it is a pointer
 * (`gen-subgraph-jsonld` refuses a literal over 16 KiB). Holding it moves no
 * licensed bytes, so there is no copyright or restriction question; it is
 * re-fetchable from the pin at any time, so there is no source-loss or
 * retention question. Asking a person four questions whose answer is fixed
 * would train them to answer without reading. `size` stays, MEASURED against
 * `maxBytes` (`--max-bytes`, default {@link DEFAULT_MAX_BYTES}) and checked
 * BEFORE the bytes are parsed, because a hydrated file is generated and a
 * generator can be wrong. The record is therefore not a
 * `MaterializationSchema` record: that schema demands all five gates, and
 * filling four with answers nobody gave is the fabrication it forbids.
 *
 * Choosing (`subscriptions[].subgraphs`) is NOT required in metadata mode: a
 * subscription already holds the substrate's root declaration as metadata,
 * and this is more of the same layer. The path must lie under a directory the
 * snapshot declares.
 *
 * Usage:
 *   bun run cat kg:materialize <subscription> <subgraph> [--decisions <file.json>] [--instance <dir>] [--dry-run]
 *   bun run cat kg:materialize <subscription> --asset <path> [--decisions <file.json>] [--instance <dir>] [--dry-run]
 *   bun run cat kg:materialize --nodes <subscription> <subgraph-path> [--max-bytes <n>] [--instance <dir>] [--dry-run]
 *   bun run cat kg:materialize:check
