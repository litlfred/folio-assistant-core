/**
 * The large-document review fixture: a before/after pair of one synthetic
 * folio, 2,000 blocks on each side, with a known edit script between them.
 *
 * @module scripts/test-fixtures/scale-pair
 *
 * Bean `xp72`, epic `q4jm`. Every review child can pass on a ten-block fixture
 * and still fall over on a real handbook, so this one is handbook-sized:
 * 10 chapters × 10 sections × 20 blocks.
 *
 * ## Synthetic, by necessity
 *
 * There is no in-repo folio to borrow (roast R7: `folios/` is a README), and
 * `smart-immunizations` renders no HTML. So the pair is GENERATED, and it is
 * deterministic: no clock, no randomness. The same call writes the same bytes
 * every time, which is what lets `scale-pair.changeset.json` be a golden file.
 * The generator is committed rather than its 8,000 output files.
 *
 * ## The edit script, and what each edit must read as
 *
 * Every kind of change the ChangeSet distinguishes is applied, once per
 * chapter or twice. Each is placed so that it cannot disturb another's
 * reading. {@link EXPECTED} is derived from the script by hand, NOT from a
 * ChangeSet run, so the golden file is checked against an independent count
 * and cannot simply confirm itself.
 *
 * | edit | where, in every chapter | reads as |
 * |---|---|---|
 * | insert | top of sections 0 and 5 | `added`, and moves nothing |
 * | remove | last block of sections 2 and 7 | `removed` |
 * | move | section 3, index 10 → end of section 4 | `moved` |
 * | rename | section 1, index 5, with `renamedFrom` | `renamed` |
 * | reword | index 8 of sections 0 and 9 | `prose` |
 * | manifest edit | section 6, index 12, gains a field | `manifest` |
 * | all at once | section 8, index 15: renamed, reworded, moved to the top of section 9 | `renamed` + `prose` + `moved` |
