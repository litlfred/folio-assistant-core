/**
 * review-comments — ingest a pull request's tagged comments into
 * `review-comment/1.0.0` todos and write `review-comments.json`. Bean
 * `423d`, epic `q4jm`.
 *
 * ## Why this is a Tool and not a workflow step
 *
 * The owner, 2026-09-23: *"make sure it is a Skill/Tool so process can be
 * modified later"*. The staging workflow only calls this command. What it does
 * lives here, declared as the `folio-review-comments` Tool (in
 * `folio-assistant-core/tools/index.ts`) and governed by the `review-comments`
 * skill. So changing the process means editing a skill and a Tool that every
 * caller shares, not a YAML step each folio has copied. An agent can run the
 * same command locally with the same result.
 *
 * ## Two ways to know the blocks, for two callers that trust different things
 *
 * - `--folio <dir>`: read the folio's manifests (as text; nothing is
 *   executed) and write `--blocks-out`. The PR build uses this, because it
 *   has checked out the PR anyway.
 * - `--blocks <file>`: the `blocks.json` that build published. The refresh
 *   triggered by a new comment uses this, so it never checks out the PR's
 *   code. That run has a WRITE token and is started by anyone who can
 *   comment, and checking out code there is the well-known way to hand that
 *   token to a stranger.
 *
 * ## Idempotent, and never drops a comment
 *
 * `--existing` is the previous `review-comments.json`. Every comment in it is
 * kept, status included. New tagged comments are added; one already ingested
 * is left alone. Then every comment is re-anchored against the head's blocks
 * (`reanchorToBlocks`): a rename is followed through `renamedFrom`, and a
 * block that is gone orphans the comment rather than deleting it.
 *
 * ## A status committed on the feature branch wins
 *
 * The owner ruled that a status change is COMMITTED to the folio's todos
 * graph on the edit-set's feature branch (`review-comment-move.ts`). With
 * `--todos <root>`, every review comment committed under the graph's
 * `todo-feedback` directory replaces the previously published copy of that
 * comment. The committed file is the reviewed record, and the published one
 * is derived. The PR build passes it. The comment-triggered refresh cannot,
 * because it checks out no feature-branch code, so it keeps the statuses the
 * last build published. A status commit is a push, and that push rebuilds.
 *
 * ## Comment bodies are data
 *
 * A body is parsed by `parseReviewTag` and stored as a string. It never
 * reaches a shell, a template or a path.
