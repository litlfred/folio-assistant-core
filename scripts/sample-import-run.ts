/**
 * Drive ONE run of `sample-import.bpmn` through the real workflow tools, doing
 * each step's work and recording what could not be done here.
 *
 * Usage:
 *   bun run folio-assistant-core/scripts/sample-import-run.ts \
 *     --root . --instance who-iris --item item/<uuid> --subject <slug> [--bean <id>] [--bundles ORIGINAL,...]
 *
 * Bean `xlg2`: the diagram had never executed. This goes through
 * `workflow_start` and `workflow_complete` as registered — the same handlers the
 * MCP server exposes, captured from a stub server as `precondition-consumer`
 * does — so the committed instance is the tools' own record, with their gates,
 * not a JSON file written to look like one.
 *
 * ## Scope: a TRIAL of an item already held
 *
 * Owner, 2026-09-29: *"WPRO as a trial"*. A trial lands in `fsh-guts/` and is
 * never published or refreshed; `library/` is not touched, so the run cannot be
 * mistaken for the provenance of the library entry, which arrived by upload.
 *
 * ## What it refuses to pretend
 *
 * - **The fetch is not performed** where egress to the source is blocked. The
 *   step is completed with a note that says so, and the held bytes are used
 *   instead only after their recorded digest is RE-COMPUTED and matches.
 * - **The gates are not re-decided.** Each is read from the item's recorded
 *   materialization, with its basis quoted; anything short of `permitted`
 *   takes the diagram's "no, or unknown" branch.
 * - **A step this driver does not know stops the run.** A diagram edit that
 *   adds a step must fail here loudly rather than be completed blind.
 *
