 * - the folio carries its own `content/pipeline/` — the `qou` layout, from
 *   when the platform was vendored inside the content repo; and
 * - the folio carries only `content/schema/` and reaches the pipeline in the
 *   platform checkout, which is what `folio_init` scaffolds.
 *
 * and a THIRD location that is not a layout at all: `folio-assistant-core/
 * scripts/`, where the content layer keeps the pipeline scripts whose subject is
 * a folio's content rather than the harness (bean `yj6r`). Searched LAST, so the
 * folio's fork still wins and the platform's copy still wins over core's — a
 * script that exists in two places was already a decided question and this does
 * not re-open it.
 *
 * Resolving ONLY against the folio meant every pipeline-backed tool — around
 * twenty-five of them, the whole QA, audit, bibliography and transform surface
 * — returned `pipeline script not found` on every scaffolded folio. That was
 * at least honest (see {@link runPipeline}), unlike the same defect in
 * `content_validate`, which reported a clean run; but honest and inert is
 * still inert.
 *
 * The folio's own copy wins when present, so a folio that has deliberately
 * forked a pipeline script keeps its fork.
