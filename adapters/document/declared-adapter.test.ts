/**
 * This instance DECLARES the document adapter, and the harness finds it there.
 *
 * Until 2026-09-30 the harness named this directory itself —
 * `../folio-assistant-core/adapters/document/index.ts` in
 * `src/builtin-adapters.ts` — and its test asserted `layer: "core"`. The
 * dependency is inverted now (bean `p11x`): the declaration lives in
 * `folio-assistant-core.json`, so the assertion that document is THIS
 * instance's lives with it.
