Findings from the as-is wireframe `cat-harness/docs/wireframes/beans/` (intent.md, as-is.html, checks/), observed at 1280×800 and 390×844. Verbatim from its `## Findings`; a finding tagged → is also covered by that cross-cutting bug.

1. **Epic labels are unreadable on a phone.** At 390 px the label column is about 120 px wide and clamps to two lines, so rows read "KG: the knowledge…", "PROCESS: how an agent decides…", "LARGE- DOCUMENT…". At 1280 px the longer titles are also clamped ("HARNESS AS INTERFACE: a harness instance's default rendering is LHS + do…"). The full title is only in the button's `title` attribute, which has no touch equivalent.
2. **The "What is stuck" sentences are squeezed into a narrow column on a phone.** The label (`BLOCK NEVER LIFTED`) keeps its own column at 390 px, so each finding runs in a column about 170 px wide, 8 to 10 lines per finding. The 7 findings take about 1.5 screens before the epic chart starts.
3. **The ✎ edit targets are 14×14 px** (measured at 1280 and 390). That is below the 24×24 px minimum target size, on the one control that leads to a write.
4. **No way back to the site.** The page has no `nav` or `header` and no link to the site home. Its only outbound links are the other state-graph cards at the bottom and GitHub bean links.
5. **The heading order skips a level.** `h1` "beans" is followed by the panel titles as `h3` ("Beans — the agent work plan", "What is stuck"). The `h2`s come later ("State graphs this harness declares", then each card is itself an `h2`).
6. **The state-graph tag runs into the name as text.** The status tag is a sibling span with no separator, so the heading's text is "beanslive", "glossaryelsewhere", "healthdeclared" (from `innerText`). A screen reader announces it that way.
7. **The page is dark by default and has no scheme control.** `:root` defaults to the dark ground, and light applies only through `data-fa-scheme="light"`. Nothing on the page sets it. (→ `folio-assistant-dc64`)

When fixed, re-draw `cat-harness/docs/wireframes/beans/` and re-run `bun run cat wireframe:check` and `bun run cat check:wireframes`.

## Re-verified 2026-09-29 on `main` 35402147f

Each finding re-measured on a local build of that commit, at 1280×800 and 390×844, both colour schemes where contrast is involved. 6 still present, 1 fixed, 0 could not be determined. FIXED means observed on the built page, not read from code.

- **STILL-PRESENT** — Epic labels are unreadable on a phone: .fa-workplan-bar-toggle label: -webkit-line-clamp 2. At 390: label width 110px, 12/12 sampled labels clipped (scrollHeight>clientHeight), 21 epics. At 1280: 288px wide, 3/12 still clipped (WIREFRAME FINDINGS 93ch, HARNESS AS INTERFACE 135ch, LARGE-DOCUMENT REVIEW 164ch). Full text only in title attr.
- **STILL-PRESENT** — The 'What is stuck' sentences are squeezed into a narrow column on a phone: At 390: li.fa-workplan-finding 284px wide, label span 92px keeps its own column, text span 183px (111px for the is-serious row); items 209-305px tall; stuck panel 1040px tall; epic chart starts at y=1481 (~1.75 screens of 844).
- **STILL-PRESENT** — The edit targets are 14x14 px: a.fa-workplan-edit bounding box 14x14 at both 1280 and 390 (4 on page).
- **FIXED** — No way back to the site: nav.fa-nav present and visible at 1280 and 390; visible link '⌂ folio-assistant' to site root; 308 links on page. — ab046420f
- **STILL-PRESENT** — The heading order skips a level: Visible heading sequence: H1 'beans' -> H3 'Beans — the agent work plan' -> H3 'What is stuck' -> H2 'State graphs this harness declares' -> H2 per card.
- **STILL-PRESENT** — The state-graph tag runs into the name as text: .sv-item h2 innerText = 'beansLIVE', 'healthDECLARED', 'issue-marksDECLARED', 'qaLIVE'; markup <span class=sv-here>beans</span><span class='sv-tag is-live'>live</span> with no separator or sr-only text.
- **STILL-PRESENT** — The page is dark by default and has no scheme control: Narrowed: page now reads localStorage fa-color-scheme (light saved -> body rgb(249,249,247), data-fa-scheme=light) via 805bbd1ba. But with prefers-color-scheme: light and nothing saved, body stays rgb(13,13,13) and data-fa-scheme is null; no scheme button on the page (the home page has 'Dark mode is on — switch to l… — 805bbd1ba

- **STILL-PRESENT** — Epic labels are unreadable on a phone: .fa-workplan-bar-toggle label uses -webkit-line-clamp 2. At 390 the label is 110px wide and 12 of 12 sampled labels are clipped (21 epics). At 1280 it is 288px wide and 3 of 12 are clipped (WIREFRAME FINDINGS 93ch, HARNESS AS INTERFACE 135ch, LARGE-DOCUMENT REVIEW 164ch). The full text is only in the title attribute. (rv-beans2.mjs)

- **FIXED** — No way back to the site: Still fixed. nav.fa-nav is visible at 1280 and 390, with a visible '⌂ folio-assistant' link to the site root. The page has 319 links. — ab046420f (rv-beans.mjs)
- **STILL-PRESENT** — The heading order skips a level: The visible headings are H1 'beans' → H3 'Beans — the agent work plan' → H3 'What is stuck' → H2 'State graphs this harness declares' → H2 per card. (rv-beans.mjs)

## Owner decision

Asked 2026-10-10 by the bean-backlog drain (lane C). The page generator is `state-visualizer.ts` in cat-harness-tools. Nothing there cites a fix yet. Re-verifying a visualiser means rebuilding and re-measuring the page, and that happens where the generator is. None of it lives in
folio-assistant-core, and AGENTS.md's one rule ("core owns content vocabulary;
the harness owns the harness") puts it outside this store's reach.

1. **(Recommended) Rehome to `litlfred/cat-harness-tools`'s bean store.** The bean is re-created
   there with this body, and this copy is scrapped with a pointer to the new id.
2. Keep it here as a pointer, and do the work from this store against `litlfred/cat-harness-tools`.
3. Scrap it. The finding no longer matters after the separation.

**Default if no answer:** option 1.
