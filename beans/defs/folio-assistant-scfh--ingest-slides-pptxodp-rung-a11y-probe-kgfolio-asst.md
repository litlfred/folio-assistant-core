Issue #1614. Owner supplied KG__folio-asst as .pptx and .odp. Add a slides rung to bun run cat ingest handling both, report accessibility, ingest the preferred (pptx) into library, list missing methodology sources, improve docs across layers.

## Done when
- [ ] slides-structure.py rung + ingest-document.ts routing + tests
- [ ] library-ingestion skill updated
- [ ] deck ingested to a library with a11y sidecar
- [ ] methodology gap list on the issue
- [ ] docs pages updated


## Follow-up on this branch (owner, 2026-09-30): ingest methodology sources 1–3 from #1614
- [x] Mehl et al. 2021, Lancet Digit Health 3(4):e213–e216 (primary for SMART L1–L5) → smart-base/library/mehl-2021-who-smart-guidelines (CC BY 3.0 IGO)
- [x] OMG BPMN 2.0.2 (ISO/IEC 19510:2013) → cat-harness/library/omg-2013-bpmn-2-0-2, RECORDED not held (licence forbids posting copies; owner chose record-don't-copy)
- [x] OMG DMN 1.5 (formal/24-01-01, verified) → cat-harness/library/omg-2024-dmn-1-5, recorded not held; now evidence on methodologies/dmn.md

Was waiting on network access (resolved: owner supplied the PDFs, commit 3dab256): the environment's proxy returns 403 for www.omg.org, doi.org, www.thelancet.com, europepmc.org and ncbi.nlm.nih.gov (measured 2026-09-30). Unblocks when the owner allows those hosts or uploads the PDFs.
