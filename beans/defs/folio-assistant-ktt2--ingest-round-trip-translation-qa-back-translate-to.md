## What

Back-translate each localized narrative into its source language and compare
meaning with the original. Flag semantic mismatch and bad terminology.

## Why a round trip rather than a forward check

A forward-only check asks "is this fluent target-language text?" — which a
confident mistranslation passes. The round trip asks whether the MEANING
survived, which is the property actually wanted, and it needs no reference
translation to work.

## What it cannot do

It can establish that two readings differ. **Which one is right is a human
call** — the diagram routes a flagged passage to a reviewer rather than
auto-correcting it.

## Done when

The round trip runs over every localized narrative in the completeness gate,
mismatches become reviewer-adjudicated findings, and a terminology miss is
distinguishable in the output from a general semantic drift.

Diagram: `processes/ingest-l1-completeness-gate.bpmn`, `Task_RoundTrip`.

## 2026-09-19T17:15Z — already answered, and better than this bean asked for

**No code written, deliberately.** Checked before building, and the substance of
this bean is already implemented in `content/pipeline/translation-block-qa.ts`
— in the one form that is honest.

### The round trip is DECLARED and deliberately has no entry

Verified in the output, not taken from the docstring: the criterion
`translation-semantic-roundtrip` exists in the sidecar shape with an **empty
entry list**, and `translation-block-qa.test.ts` proves an agent-supplied
verdict merges into it when one exists. So the slot is real, visibly empty, and
ready — rather than absent, which would read as "nobody thought of it".

The reasoning, already recorded there and better than this bean's framing:

> The only back-translation available offline is reversing the PO's own
> msgid→msgstr map, which returns the source **exactly, always** — a similarity
> of 1.0 that measures the lookup table, not the translation. A score computed
> that way would be a verdict with a script's name on it and no content, which
> is worse than the gap: a reader who sees a green round-trip stops asking.

That is this bean's "Why a round trip rather than a forward check" carried one
step further: a round trip with a *dependent* translator is not a round trip.

### "A terminology miss distinguishable from semantic drift" — already true

`translation-terms-preserved` is a **separate criterion** from the semantic one,
covering acronyms, numbers and URLs that must survive. So the distinction this
bean asks for exists structurally, not as a note in a report.

### Why "Done when" cannot be satisfied today, with numbers

1. **Zero narratives exist.** Every `narrative` record in `library/` is
   `not-authored` (`ju0u`), so there are no localized narratives to round-trip.
2. **Zero translated blocks.** `bun run cat translation:block-qa` reports
   **`Wrote 0 sidecar(s); 609 (block, locale) pair(s) have no translation`** —
   even the three deterministic criteria have nothing to run over.
3. **No independent translator.** Point 3 is the one that does not go away when
   content arrives, and it is the same class of blocker as `68dt`: a capability
   this environment lacks, for a service rather than a package.

### Blocked

- **waits on**: an independent back-translator — a model or MT service that has
  not seen the source. Plus content to run it over (`d5f1` / `1r0p` produce the
  localized narratives; both carried a block against `68dt`, and as of
  2026-09-22 each is **not blocked on `68dt`** because it completed).
- **since**: 2026-09-19.
- **expires**: 2026-10-19. Re-measure rather than trusting this.
- **handoff**: **do not build a PO-reversal round trip to close this.** It
  returns 1.0 always and would make the gap invisible, which is the one outcome
  worse than the gap. If a translator becomes available, the slot is already
  there — supply agent entries for `translation-semantic-roundtrip`; no schema
  change is needed.



## Handover 2026-10-06 — PAUSED until the repo separation lands (Session F, GOAL 5)

Owner ruling, relayed by the coordinating session (session_012qoycyCSGidZqW245vXhze): repo separation is the primary goal, content authoring/review/publication goes to folio-assistant-core while cat-harness keeps the methods, and that 'needs to be done before F'. This bean resumes AFTER the split. **The code it touches may have moved to folio-assistant-core by then — re-locate it before editing, and re-measure.** Open questions on it are being put to the owner by the coordinating session, one at a time; the answer will be recorded here, not assumed.

## Owner ruling 2026-10-06: an agent back-translates, and that mechanism already exists

Asked in https://claude.ai/code/session_012qoycyCSGidZqW245vXhze. **The owner chose the agent back-translator** and added, verbatim: *"should already be ethe skill."*

**Verified: it is.** `cat-harness/content/pipeline/translation-roundtrip.ts` records an agentic semantic round trip as witnesses on a block's translation sidecar, with two parties kept apart:
- the **back-translator** sees only the target-language text;
- the **adjudicator** sees the original and the back-translation, and rules.

Both are recorded, and they are governed by the `untainted-verification` skill (`UntaintedDispatch`, `mergeUntainted`). `translation-manager.md` §5 documents the criterion. This bean's 2026-09-19 entry predates that code, which is why it read as unbuilt.

**What is left:** run it over the translations that now exist (who-iris in the six UN languages, #2229), and wire the L1 completeness gate's `Task_RoundTrip` to it. Then close this bean on that evidence. This waits until after the content split.
