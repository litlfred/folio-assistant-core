title: 'PUBLIC COMMENT: a PR body that merely MENTIONS a change-set id re-links an already-incorporated change-set to it, and the record writer drops $schema'

Measured 2026-10-06 on litlfred/smart-ra#24 (a submodule-pin staging PR whose body named CS-236 and CS-237 in prose). The public-comment workflow (pull_request_target, platform pinned at 7a2ff7e) committed 5f4ce41 to smart-ra main: both change-sets' pr moved from #9 (the merged PR that made the change) to #24, history gained 'PR #24 is making the change', and both files LOST their "$schema": "changeset/1.0.0" line.

Two defects:
1. Linking: onPullRequest (folio-assistant-core/scripts/public-comment-changesets.ts) links any PR whose body contains a CS-nnn id, even in prose, and even when the change-set is already incorporated with a different merged PR. A settled change-set must not be re-linked; prose mentions should not count (require a keyword such as 'Closes CS-236' or 'cs: CS-236').
2. Writer: the save path drops $schema from the change-set record.

## Done when
- [x] an incorporated change-set is never re-linked to another PR (test)
- [x] only an explicit keyword links a PR to a change-set (test), and the public-comment skill says which
- [x] the record writer keeps $schema (test)
- [x] smart-ra's CS-236 / CS-237 records restored (d4331c3)


_2026-10-06T15:00Z_ — smart-ra CS-236 / CS-237 restored on main by d4331c3 (revert of 5f4ce41), on the owner's instruction.

_2026-10-07T07:49:45Z_ — Claimed by claude/exciting-ptolemy-se2d2a — pushed to main so sibling sessions see it before this branch has a PR (bean 35nj).

*2026-10-07* — the three remaining items are done on branch claude/exciting-ptolemy-se2d2a: linkedChangeSets() makes only a keyword (Closes/fixes/resolves CS-nnn, or a cs: line) link a PR; a SETTLED (incorporated/closed) change-set is never re-linked; a test holds that the writer keeps $schema. The skill says which keywords link. Tests: public-comment.test.ts, 44 pass.

*2026-10-07* — completed: merged in litlfred/folio-assistant#2403 (b61b125); smart-ra pin bump litlfred/smart-ra#30.
