Owner 2026-10-02: the beans page should show a generated date so a reviewer knows how recent it is, and how many commits behind main.

## Constraint
Bean y7b3: no timestamp in a committed generated file (owner ruling 2026-09-30). So the stamp is written by the DEPLOY (docs-site.yml -> _site/build.json; previews already have staging.json) and read at load time; the behind-count is asked of the GitHub compare API at load time. Failure renders 'could not determine', never 'up to date'.

## Done when
- [x] docs-site.yml writes _site/build.json
- [x] fa-build-src meta on visualiser pages and Jekyll pages
- [x] work-plan.js renders the stamp
- [x] verified on the live site after merge (gh-pages a7bd7b1: build.json from main@0e20a22 + new beans page)

## Summary of Changes

Landed in #1851 (`9eecdc6`). Deploy writes _site/build.json; work-plan.js renders 'Generated … from <sha> · N commits behind main'; verified live 2026-10-02.
