Recorded from the qou orphaned-content census, 2026-10-04 (ORPH report; session https://claude.ai/code/session_01NdDGeP1SyShmoUssLuRZ91, issue #2106). qou: 654 of 1,309 lean.refs (50%) resolve into the compiled library; 833 chapter-dir .lean siblings declare names absent from any lake target; 582 blocks' lean.ref resolves only to an uncompiled sibling. The paper adapter's no-orphan-lean is satisfied by all of them. Proposed: resolve each lean.ref against the declarations of the lake targets CI builds; report built / sibling-only / dangling.
