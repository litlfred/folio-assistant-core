Owner, 2026-10-01: 'make sure that these issues are part of the one voice for jsonld'; then chose option 1 — a new voice, with 'jsonld' added as a voice target, owned by cat-harness, each rule cited (check:voices enforces citations).

Rules (from jcet and the PROV measurement, each to be cited verbatim to a held source):
1. object properties are links (@type @id), never literals — measured: 100 activities in 9 PROV reports carry agent/hadRole/hadPlan as @value
2. a link's value is the node's release address (<iriBase><version>/<path>[#frag], the check:node-iris rule); where none exists, keep the literal AND raise a finding
3. no @base in a remote context (JSON-LD 1.1 §4.1.3) — measured: works today only through jsonld.js
4. no context fetched at run time; an external context is held locally with its sha256
5. coercion attaches to TERMS: a compact-IRI key does not inherit a term's @type
6. PROV is written in PROV-JSONLD's shape (W3C Member Submission 2024)

## Done when
- [x] ~~'jsonld'~~ 'code' is a voice target (owner: "a voice for a coding agent, in a code authoring or review task"); judgesBlocks keeps it off folio prose
- [x] folio-assistant-core/skills/voices/linked-data/voice.json, 7 rules, in force for authoring-agent and code-reviewer in Process_CodeChangeReview / Process_CodeReview; check:voices green; every quote verified verbatim (owner 2026-09-21: the platform holds no voice content, so NOT cat-harness)
- [x] json-ld-serialisation and prov-o-provenance methodology nodes point at the voice; prov-o cites library/w3c-2024-prov-jsonld
- [x] regen fixed point; CI — green on 66eb33e28, merged as litlfred/folio-assistant#1791 (2026-10-02)


Measured 2026-10-01 on #1791: editing cat-harness/scripts/check-l1-complete.ts changes its script_hash, so all 61 library-qa verdicts went stale. `bun run cat regen` does not run `check:l1-complete -- --write`, so CI caught it (Repository gates, step 'gates that were registered and never run'). This is one more writer in regen's coverage gap.


## Summary of Changes (closed 2026-10-02, session_01CVVoavPoCHMLA7AASxG8cH)
Merged as #1791: the `linked-data` voice (7 rules, every quote verified against held W3C text) is in force for coding agents in the code authoring and review processes. `"code"` is a voice artefact kind. PROV is emitted as PROV-JSONLD links at release addresses, and the methodology nodes point at the voice. The regen coverage gap (writers `regen` does not run, such as `check:l1-complete --write`) is recorded above as measured.
