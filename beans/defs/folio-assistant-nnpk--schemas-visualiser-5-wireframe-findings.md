Findings from the as-is wireframe `cat-harness/docs/wireframes/schemas/` (intent.md, as-is.html, checks/), observed at 1280×800 and 390×844. Verbatim from its `## Findings`; a finding tagged → is also covered by that cross-cutting bug.

1. **On a phone, picking a declaration shows nothing.** The detail pane is below the 560 px list box, and selecting an item leaves the page where it is (`scrollY` stays 0). The reader sees the highlight move and has to know to scroll past the list to find the result.
2. **Nested scrolling on a phone.** The 812-item list is a 560 px scroll box inside a scrolling page. At 390×844 the box takes about two-thirds of the screen height, so most swipes over the page land in the list.
3. **The diagram's instruction points the wrong way.** Opened with no module chosen, the panel says "Pick a **module** in the filter above", but the module filter is *below* the diagram. The panel also keeps about 200 px of empty height.
4. **The field table breaks identifiers mid-token at 390 px.** "n_entrie / s", "uncompre / ssed_byt / es", "z.literal(ARC / HIVE_CONTENTS / _SCHEMA_ID)". Names and types become hard to read or copy.
5. **The UML box truncates field types** at a fixed width, even at 1280 px ("$schema: literal(ARCHIVE_CONTENTS_SCH", "n_directories: number().int().nonnegative("). The full types appear only in the Fields table below.

When fixed, re-draw `cat-harness/docs/wireframes/schemas/` and re-run `bun run cat wireframe:check` and `bun run cat check:wireframes`.

## Re-verified 2026-09-29 on `main` 35402147f

Each finding re-measured on a local build of that commit, at 1280×800 and 390×844, both colour schemes where contrast is involved. 5 still present, 0 fixed, 0 could not be determined. FIXED means observed on the built page, not read from code.

- **STILL-PRESENT** — On a phone, picking a declaration shows nothing (detail below list, scrollY stays 0): 390x844: selecting ArchiveContentsSchema leaves scrollY at 0. #detail top is 822 px in an 844 px viewport, so only 22 px shows. Focus is not moved into #detail.
- **STILL-PRESENT** — Nested scrolling on a phone (list scroll box ~2/3 screen): #items overflow-y auto, max-height 590.8 px at 390x844 (70% of height; 560 px at 1280). 400 li rendered of 1036 declarations (was 812).
- **STILL-PRESENT** — Diagram instruction says 'filter above' but module filter is below; empty height: details#overview opened: #ov-cap says 'Pick a module in the filter above...'. The caption is at y 335 and select#mod at y 723 (390); at 1280 they are at 187 and 473. #ov-svg is 150 px tall with 0 children; .ov-body is 287 px (390) and 228 px (1280).
- **STILL-PRESENT** — Field table breaks identifiers mid-token at 390 px: At 390, 10 space-free cells wrap onto more than one line, incl. 'n_entries', 'z.literal(ARCHIVE_CONTENTS_SCHEMA_ID)', '$schema', 'archive', 'entries'. At 1280, 7 still wrap, incl. 'uncompressed_bytes'.
- **STILL-PRESENT** — UML box truncates field types at fixed width even at 1280: #detail svg text at 1280 includes '$schema: literal(ARCHIVE_CONTENTS_SCH' and 'archive: record(z.string(), z.unknown'. The full types appear only in the table.

## Owner decision

Asked 2026-10-10 by the bean-backlog drain (lane C). The page generator is `scripts/gen-schema-viz.ts` in cat-harness-tools. `gen-schema-viz.test.ts` cites fixes for findings 1–5, so a re-verify is likely to close it. Re-verifying a visualiser means rebuilding and re-measuring the page, and that happens where the generator is. None of it lives in
folio-assistant-core, and AGENTS.md's one rule ("core owns content vocabulary;
the harness owns the harness") puts it outside this store's reach.

1. **(Recommended) Rehome to `litlfred/cat-harness-tools`'s bean store.** The bean is re-created
   there with this body, and this copy is scrapped with a pointer to the new id.
2. Keep it here as a pointer, and do the work from this store against `litlfred/cat-harness-tools`.
3. Scrap it. The finding no longer matters after the separation.

**Default if no answer:** option 1.
