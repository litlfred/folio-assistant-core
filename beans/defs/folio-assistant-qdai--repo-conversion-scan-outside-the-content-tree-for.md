Recorded from the qou orphaned-content census, 2026-10-04 (ORPH report; session https://claude.ai/code/session_01NdDGeP1SyShmoUssLuRZ91, issue #2106). qou: 30 docs/audits/*.lean (several are refutations of paper claims, e.g. skein-mass-relation-is-false), 68 docs/audits/*.py computations and 272 derivation notes live outside folio/ and are linked by no block. A conversion that carries only the content tree drops the evidence that some claims are false. The repo-conversion skill should classify these as candidates, read-only, like the rest of its scan.
