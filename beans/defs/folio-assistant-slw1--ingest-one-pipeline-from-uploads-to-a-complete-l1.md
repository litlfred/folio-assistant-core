The `uploads/` → `library/` path, and what "complete" means at L1.

Nine of these are the per-format arms (audio, images, CSV, archives, technical
metadata, provenance, round-trip translation QA) and two are the spine: `apui`
gives them ONE documented entry point, and `pn6j` is the gate that says the
derived content is actually present before L1 counts as complete. Without the
spine the arms are nine scripts nobody can run in order; without the arms the
gate has nothing to check.

`r1lz` sits here rather than under voices: ingesting the three WHO style guides
INTO `library/` is this pipeline's job, and deriving voices from them is what
happens afterwards.
