Owner, 2026-09-29: *"show highlevel (sub)process bpmn on the uploads page."*

The uploads page is `uploads/README.md`, the generated subgraph README written
by `cat-harness/scripts/subgraph-readmes.ts` through the `subgraph` Liquid
template in the tools graph.

## What is being added

A new optional declared field on `SubgraphCoverageSchema` naming the BPMN
process that GOVERNS a directory, declared on `uploads/` as
`document-ingestion`. The generator resolves the name to its `.bpmn` source and
its rendered SVG and the template embeds it, with links to the source and to
the five subprocesses the diagram calls.

## Why DECLARED and not inferred

`document-ingestion.bpmn`'s start event is named "A file lands in uploads/",
so the directory could be inferred from the prose. It is not: inferring a
declared relation from a name is the failure this repository keeps paying for,
and the name is editorial text free to change without anything noticing.

## The third state

Absent means NOT DECLARED, never "no process" — the `readOnly` pattern in the
same file. A directory that declares nothing gets no section and that is not a
finding. A directory that declares a process whose SVG is missing gets a
*could not determine* line rather than a silently omitted section.

## Also stated on the page

The diagram's first element is an EVENT, not a Task: the process begins AFTER
arrival and models nothing about HOW a file gets into `uploads/` — a git
commit, a file handed to an agent in chat, or the GitHub web UI. That gap is
real: a web-UI commit on 2026-09-29 (`c8349950fa5`, direct to `main`, no PR)
added three PDFs and reddened the blocking `readme:subgraphs:check`, because a
web-UI commit runs no generator. The page states the routes are ungoverned; it
does NOT document procedures for them, because no skill governs them yet.

## Done when

- `SubgraphCoverageSchema` carries the optional declared field, documented.
- `uploads/` declares it in `folio-assistant.json`.
- `uploads/README.md` shows the diagram, the source link, the five
  subprocesses, and the stated boundary.
- `readme:subgraphs:check`, `render:bpmn:check` and `gates` are green.
- Synthetic-tree tests cover: declares-a-process embeds it; declares none gets
  no section; declared-but-missing yields *could not determine*.

## Out of scope, awaiting the owner's sign-off

An upload Task in the BPMN, a skill for the three routes, Tool nodes for them,
or a page generated from Tool documentation. The upload is modelled as a start
event, so there is no Task and no Tool documentation to generate from; creating
them is an authoring act.



## Tracking

GitHub issue: https://github.com/litlfred/folio-assistant/issues/1526
Branch: `claude/uploads-page-shows-process`



## Round 1 landed — PR #1529, not merged

https://github.com/litlfred/folio-assistant/pull/1529

Open questions put to the owner on issue #1526 (one asked in full, two
recorded):

1. **Asked.** Is the page generated from Tool documentation still wanted,
   given the upload is a start event and there is no Task to carry a Tool?
   Options (a) model an upload Task + skill + Tool nodes, (b) drop the page
   and let the boundary paragraph be the answer, (c) generate from something
   other than a Tool. Recommended (a), as its own issue and PR.
2. **Recorded, not asked.** Should `cat-harness/uploads/` — the harness
   layer's own queue — declare the same `coverage.process`? It is a
   different instance's directory sharing an id; the ingestion process is
   arguably the same one. One-line declaration either way.
3. **Recorded, not asked.** The `## Files` heading the subgraph template now
   emits is CONDITIONAL — written only where a section precedes the table, so
   only `uploads/README.md` has one today. Unconditional would be more
   consistent and would churn all 90 subgraph READMEs in one commit.

## Summary of Changes

Closed on evidence 2026-09-30. PR #1529 was merged by the owner on 2026-09-30 and #1526 was closed as completed.

- The `SubgraphCoverageSchema` `process` field is shipped and documented.
- `uploads/` declares `document-ingestion`.
- `uploads/README.md` shows the diagram (5 mentions on main).
- `readme:subgraphs:check` on main reports 0 stale and 0 unresolved processes.
- The synthetic-tree tests shipped in #1529.

**One question stays open, recorded rather than decided:** #1529's question 1, whether a page generated from Tool documentation is still wanted given the upload is a start event. The owner merged without answering it. It is not a Done-when item of this bean, so it does not hold the bean open. It is the next thing to ask if upload governance comes up.
