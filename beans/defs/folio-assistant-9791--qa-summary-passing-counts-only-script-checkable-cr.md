# folio-assistant-9791
title: 'QA SUMMARY: ''passing'' counts only script-checkable criteria — agent-judged criteria never run are not said (heat map reads it as QA passed)'

Found while doing tw61, 2026-09-23. On a freshly scaffolded document folio, a sweep records 46 criteria per block, and every recorded one passes or is n/a. `publish-block-qa` then says **"passing"**. But about 15 criteria that need an agent's judgement were never run: voice traps, exposition clarity, adversarial review. They appear in the sweep output as `[needs-agent]` and nowhere in the verdict file. So "passing" means "every script-checkable criterion passes". The heat map does not say so, and a reviewer reads it as "QA passed".

It is the same rule as stale-versus-passing, one level up: a verdict that was never given is not a pass.

## Done when
- [ ] the summary distinguishes "passing, scripts only (N criteria need an agent)" from "passing, every applicable criterion judged". The heat map says it in words, per section
- [ ] the criteria counted as "need an agent" come from the criteria's own declarations, never from a list written here



## Progress (2026-09-24)
- `publish-block-qa` now gives each block `needsAgent`: its applicable criteria declared `automated: false` (gated by `applies_to` and the active voices, as the sweep gates them) that have no fresh verdict. It also adds `passingScriptsOnly` to the file.
- The heat map reads "N passing on scripts only (M criteria need an agent)" or "passing, every applicable criterion judged" per section. A pre-9791 file reads "does not say", never "all judged".



## Claim released 2026-09-29

Released `in-progress` → `todo` on the owner's instruction (review session https://claude.ai/code/session_014Qj8wncQhqV52QGN1yZDnj). No git change to this bean since before 2026-09-26, and no holder recorded; the sessions that held theme C (rendered site) work stopped on the 2026-09-25 weekly usage limit. Nothing in the body was changed: re-claim with `bun run cat beans:claim <id>`.

## Owner ruling 2026-10-06: the QA-column work waits for #2080

Chosen directly by the owner in https://claude.ai/code/session_012qoycyCSGidZqW245vXhze, from two options (recommended first):

1. **CHOSEN: hold the heat map's QA-column work until #2080 (5hox, QA results off main) merges.** The column reads per-block QA files that #2080 moves to the `qa-reports` branch, so it is built once, against where the files will live.
2. Build now and adapt after #2080 (not chosen: the same reader would be reworked twice).

The rest of q4jm (the end-to-end check on folio-test, comments, accept, the large fixture) is not held.

## Evidence: Closed on Landed Work

Closed on owner ruling (commit `a1d9e4f32af1`) and landed dependencies:
- Owner ruled that heat map QA-column work waited for PR #2080 (bean `5hox`, QA results off main).
- PR #2080 has landed on `main` (commit `4318b9a6ed65`), and qa-reports branch stores derived verdicts.
