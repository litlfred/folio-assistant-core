Owner screenshot 2026-10-02 of https://litlfred.github.io/folio-assistant/beans/ with type: epic selected: the active chip is a blank black pill in light mode.

## Cause
work-plan.css .fa-workplan-type-btn.is-active set color: var(--fa-wp-bg, #0d0d0d). Nothing defines --fa-wp-bg, so the fallback #0d0d0d painted on the light scheme's ink #0b0b0b.

## Done when
- [x] use --fa-wp-surface (defined in both schemes)
- [x] regenerate visualiser pages (they inline the CSS)
- [x] rendered and looked at in light mode

## Summary of Changes

Landed in #1851 (`9eecdc6`). Selected type chip uses --fa-wp-surface; readable in light mode.
