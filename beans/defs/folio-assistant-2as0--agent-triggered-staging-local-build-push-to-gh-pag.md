Issue #2410. PR 1: cat-harness/scripts/stage-local.ts builds the folio's preview in the agent's checkout and pushes STAGING/<slug>/ through the same gate and render log as the workflow. PR 2: --artifact publishes it as a claude.ai Artifact. Measured 2026-10-07: 33 min runner queue before the workflow ran 45 s; Pages deploy 47 min queued.
