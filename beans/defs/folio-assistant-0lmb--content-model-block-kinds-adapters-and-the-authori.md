The block kinds and adapters an author actually writes against.

`55ao` is the one with the largest blast radius — a real `recommendation` kind
means a builder, a Zod schema, a label prefix, viewer registration, constraint
rows and QA criteria, about thirty files — and it is tracked rather than
half-done for exactly that reason. `cz17` brings the DAK type in properly.

`6xaz` and `bqrg` are the authoring surface misbehaving: a TOC inferred from a
worked EXAMPLE and shipped as the document's own structure, and one lexer
implemented six times.
