# Document Intake

> **Bib human-review integration.** Track per-upload ingestion
> status beside the upload's records in `uploads/<document-id>/` (identified passage, formalised?, matched?) and
> link each upload to the `references.ts` entry it sources. An upload that
> supplies a cited source moves that ref to `source-in-repo` (agent-identified
> passage; no human photo) and then through the
> [`bib-human-review`](../cataloguing/bib-human-review.md) ladder to `validated`. Existing
> `uploads/` follow the same agent-sourced path.

## Overview

This skill manages the `uploads/` directory as an intake pipeline for
converting raw documents into structured content objects. It handles:

1. **Scanned PDFs / images** — OCR extraction → text → blocks
2. **LaTeX source** — environment extraction → blocks
3. **Structured / normative guidelines** — normative structure → blocks
4. **arXiv papers** — fetched source → blocks (delegates to paper-importer)
5. **Arbitrary documents** — best-effort structural analysis

The key distinction from `paper-importer`: this skill owns the full
lifecycle of `uploads/`, including tracking processing state, partial
extractions, and multi-pass refinement. Paper-importer focuses on the
final content-object generation step.

## When to Use This Skill

- User says "upload", "scan", "process document", "intake"
- User drops a file into `uploads/`
- User mentions a guideline, standard, or normative document
- User wants to convert a raw document into content objects
- Files appear in `uploads/` that haven't been processed yet

## uploads/ Directory Convention

```
uploads/
  <document-id>/
    intake.json                  ← what arrived and where from (folio-intake/v1)
    <document-id>.dc.json        ← what it is: title, type, subject (folio-dublin-core/v1)
    original.pdf                 ← raw upload (PDF, scan, etc.)
    original.tex                 ← or LaTeX source
    extracted-text.md            ← OCR or parser output (intermediate)
    extracted-blocks.json        ← structured extraction (intermediate)
    mapping.json                 ← label/section mapping decisions
    README.md                    ← human notes about the document
```

### The two records an upload writes

Rebuilt from schemas this repository already had (#1168 B6b-2, bean `d4lb`).
The description is a Dublin Core record; the intake records the capture and
points at it. Both are validated by the registry (`check:kind-validators`).

`intake.json` — `folio-intake/v1`, `cat-harness/schemas/intake.ts`:

```json
{
  "$schema": "folio-intake/v1",
  "doc_id": "example-doc-2016",
  "record": "example-doc-2016.dc.json",
  "source": {
    "upstream": "https://...",
    "capturedAt": "2026-03-25T10:00:00Z",
    "capturedBy": "folio-assistant document adapter: the upload form"
  },
  "files": [
    { "path": "original.pdf", "bytes": 123456, "sha256": "…", "type": "upload", "role": "original-bitstream" }
  ]
}
```

An intake names what it is a capture OF: a catalogue `item` (a
`folio-catalogue-node/v1` id), a Dublin Core `record`, or — only when
neither exists — its own `title`. `source` is `ProvenanceSchema` (`upstream`
for a URL, absent for a direct upload) plus the capture moment.

`<document-id>.dc.json` — `folio-dublin-core/v1`:

| upload field | Dublin Core |
|---|---|
| title | `dc.title` |
| type (`guideline`, `paper`, `report`, `standard`) | `dc.type` |
| domain | `dc.subject` |
| normative level | `dc.type` qualified `normativeLevel` |
| detected format (`pdf`, `latex`, `scan`, `docx`) | `dc.format` |

## Pipeline Stages

### Stage 1: Upload (→ `uploaded`)

Place raw files in `uploads/<document-id>/`. Create `intake.json`
with source metadata. Files are committed to git for reproducibility.

**Record the licence in `intake.json` when you know it.** The ingestion
pipeline's licence step runs EARLY — before any extraction, by the owner's
ruling on bean `7bg9` — because `library/` is committed content and refusing a
source after deriving from it is a deletion nobody may take unasked. That step
sees only the upload: the `licence` record in `intake.json` (the same
`stated` / `unknown` record a library manifest carries in `meta.licence`,
`schemas/source-licence.ts`) and whether a `LICENSE` file sits beside it.
`bun run cat ingest` prints its verdict before the first arm runs, and after the
arms it writes a recorded licence into the staged entry's `licence.json` — the
authored sidecar `gen-library-jsonld` carries into `meta.licence` (the manifest
itself is generated, so a licence written there would not survive a
regeneration). It never overwrites a `licence.json` already there; a mismatch
is printed as a conflict.

| verdict | when | what to do |
|---|---|---|
| `stated` | `licence: { status: "stated", id, basis }` | nothing — `basis` says where it is stated |
| `unknown` | `licence: { status: "unknown", searched: [...] }` | nothing now; the places tried are the record |
| `undetermined` | no licence recorded (a `LICENSE` sibling is named, not read) | ingestion proceeds, and says so — undetermined is never reported as cleared |

It never reads a licence out of extracted text; that is a later check's job.

Supported formats:
- **PDF** — academic papers, scanned guidelines, reports
- **LaTeX** — `.tex` source bundles
- **HTML** — web-published guidelines, standards
- **DOCX** — Word documents
- **Images** — scanned pages (PNG, JPG, TIFF)

**For academic papers, prefer the MCP fetch path:**
when the session network allows the upstream host, use
`paper-search-mcp` (arxiv / PubMed / bioRxiv / medRxiv) or
`openalex-paper-search` (alex-mcp; OpenAlex catalog) rather than
`curl`/`WebFetch`. The MCP tools return canonical metadata and the
PDF in one call, eliminating the OCR-then-extract-then-name dance.
See `paper-importer.md §Phase 1` (folio-assistant-sci)
for the per-tool routing table. Sandboxed Claude-Code-on-the-web
sessions (github-only allowlist) cannot reach those hosts; in
those sessions, queue the fetch onto a normal-network machine
per [`bib-qa.md §Batch intake pipeline`](../cataloguing/bib-qa.md#batch-intake-pipeline).

### Stage 2: Extraction (→ `extracted`)

Convert raw format to `extracted-text.md`:

**For PDFs, always start with
[`cat-harness/scripts/pdf-extract.py`](../../../../cat-harness/scripts/pdf-extract.py)** — do not reach for a
Python PDF library directly. It walks a fallback ladder (`pdftotext` → `pypdf` →
`pdfminer.six` → a zero-dependency content-stream extractor → OCR) and, when it
cannot read a file, **tells you which rung failed and why** instead of returning
an empty string:

```bash
python3 cat-harness/scripts/pdf-extract.py FILE.pdf -o extracted-text.md
python3 cat-harness/scripts/pdf-extract.py FILE.pdf --diagnose   # structure only
```

Exit `0` = text; **exit `2` = no text layer (a scan)**; exit `3` = a parser
problem on a file that does have text.

Two failure modes it exists to prevent, both observed in practice:

* **A silent empty extraction reads exactly like a scan, a broken library, and
  a malformed PDF.** The script separates them by inspecting the PDF structure
  (`CCITTFaxDecode` / `JBIG2Decode` / `DCTDecode` counts against `/Font`), so
  "swap libraries" vs "you need OCR" is decided by evidence rather than guessed.
* **A broken native extension kills the whole pipeline.** `pypdf` and
  `pdfminer.six` both fail via pyo3 `PanicException` when `cryptography`'s Rust
  bindings are broken — and that is a `BaseException`, so an ordinary
  `except Exception` does **not** catch it. Every rung is guarded accordingly.
  The zero-dependency rung exists precisely for this case; in the container this
  was written in it was the only rung that worked.

| Format | Extraction method |
|--------|-------------------|
| PDF (text) | `cat-harness/scripts/pdf-extract.py` (ladder; `pdftotext` when available) |
| PDF (scan) | `cat-harness/scripts/pdf-extract.py` → exit 2, then `cat-harness/scripts/pdf-ocr.py` (Tesseract) or Claude vision |
| LaTeX | Direct parse (strip preamble) |
| HTML | Readability + turndown |
| DOCX | Pandoc → markdown |
| Images | Claude vision API |
| PDF (tables/figures) | `cat-harness/scripts/pdf-tables.py` → `tables.json` (see Stage 3) |
| PDF (sections) | `cat-harness/scripts/pdf-structure.py` → `structure.json` + `sections/*.md` (see Stage 3) |

For scanned documents the script's OCR rung fires automatically **if**
`tesseract` and `pdftoppm` are installed (`apt-get install -y tesseract-ocr
poppler-utils`); it names whichever is missing. Where OCR is unavailable, or
where layout carries meaning (headings, lists, tables, boxes), fall back to
Claude's vision capability, which reads structure that OCR flattens.

**Output**: `extracted-text.md` — raw markdown with preserved structure.

### Stage 3: Structural Analysis (→ `structured`)

Analyze extracted text for formal environments and document structure.

#### The three producers this stage actually runs

**Documented here because nothing else named them**, and they are the scripts
that built the corpus: measured on `qou`, 715 `library/*/structure.json` and 26
`library/*/ocr/` trees exist, and until now no skill in either repo pointed at
the programs that wrote them. An agent following Stage 2 alone reaches
`pdf-extract.py`, which writes loose text — not the greppable `sections/` tree
the corpus-grep checklist reads.

| script | writes | notes |
|---|---|---|
| [`cat-harness/scripts/pdf-structure.py`](../../../../cat-harness/scripts/pdf-structure.py) | `library/<doc-id>/structure.json` + `sections/NN-slug.md` | metadata (a page-1 title GUESS, authors, arXiv/DOI from the page-1 stamp, and the PDF Info dictionary as `docinfo`), TOC from the PDF outline, or else inferred from the layout (see the note below), per-section text split. The page-1 guess is **never** the entry's title: [`l1-document-ingestion`](l1-document-ingestion.md) §"A manifest's title" gives the order (catalogue record → `referenced.json` → PDF `/Title` → slug) |
| [`cat-harness/scripts/pdf-ocr.py`](../../../../cat-harness/scripts/pdf-ocr.py) | `library/<doc-id>/ocr/page-NNN.txt` | `pdftoppm -r 300 -png` then `tesseract`; per-page cache; script auto-detected via Tesseract's own OSD |
| [`cat-harness/scripts/extract-candidates.py`](../../../../cat-harness/scripts/extract-candidates.py) | `library/<doc-id>/candidates.json` | pure regex, imports no PDF library; **proposals, never content** — nothing here writes to `content/` and nothing here creates Lean |

```bash
python3 cat-harness/scripts/pdf-ocr.py FILE.pdf --outdir library/<doc-id>/   # only if scanned
python3 cat-harness/scripts/pdf-structure.py FILE.pdf --outdir library --ocr
python3 cat-harness/scripts/extract-candidates.py library/<doc-id>/
```

Three things about how they fit together, each of which has already cost
someone time:

* **`pdf-structure.py` READS OCR, it never runs it.** Its `--ocr` flag consults
  the cache `pdf-ocr.py` wrote, gated on `text_is_unusable()` (under 120
  chars/page, or under 55 % letters — mojibake). So on a scanned document the
  order is `pdf-ocr.py` first, `pdf-structure.py --ocr` second. Run them the
  other way round and the sections come out empty.
* **An OCR'd document whose structure was never re-run is invisible to the
  section grep.** Measured on `qou`: 26 `ocr/` directories exist but only 11
  `structure.json` record `"text_source": "ocr"` — so roughly 15 documents have
  their text on disk and a stub in `sections/`. A `sections/` grep misses them
  entirely. `library/procrsoclondona92/` is the worked case: 1,916 bytes of
  JSTOR download banner in `sections/` against 46,511 bytes of real text in
  `ocr/`.
* **The backends are optional and their absence is reported, not guessed.**
  `pdf-structure.py` prefers PyMuPDF (better text on maths, real outlines) and
  falls back to `pypdf`; the Dockerfile ships `pypdf` only, deliberately, so the
  image stays BSD-licensed against PyMuPDF's AGPL. Check with
  `python3 cat-harness/scripts/pdf-ocr.py --check`.
* **With no outline, the TOC is inferred from the LAYOUT, and the artefact
  says how.** `diagnostics.toc_inferred_method` is `contents` (a printed
  contents page, its page labels moved to physical pages by finding the titles
  in the body), `font` (lines set in a heading style: larger, bold, capitals or
  italic, numbered or not) or `regex` (text patterns — the last resort, used
  for OCR'd text, which has no fonts). Weight a `regex` TOC lowest. Each
  inferred entry also carries `confidence` (0..1) and `evidence` — which
  independent checks agreed: listed on the contents page, found in the body
  near the page it names, set in a heading style, numbered. Trust the high
  ones; look at the flagged ones before citing them. An inferred TOC is used
  only when it passes the concentration check, its mean confidence is at
  least 0.6, and no more than a quarter of the sections it would cut are
  empty; otherwise the entry is split one section per page
  (`granularity: "page"`, with the reason in `structure_note`) —
  `l1-document-ingestion` §"The route `pdf-structure.py` takes itself". Measured over the 13
  corpus PDFs that carry an outline, hidden and used as the answer key: title
  F1 0.83 for this consensus on 20 held-out PDFs (0.92 on the development set) against 0.26 for text patterns alone (issue
  #2302). The same artefact carries `figures` — the list of figures and
  tables, each caption with `confidence` and `evidence` (cited in the text,
  in its numbering run, a graphic on its page) — with numbering gaps in
  `diagnostics.figure_sequence_gaps`; and, when the document has a printed
  contents page, `diagnostics.toc_alignment`: entries the body no longer
  carries, numbered sections the contents omits, and page mismatches. On a
  draft, read these as findings about the document. Every page also has a
  printed label: `pages[]` (physical index, the label a reader sees, which
  sources agreed), `page_label` on TOC entries and figures, and
  `label_start`/`label_end` on sections. **Cite the label, not the physical
  index**; `diagnostics.page_label_conflicts` lists pages where the PDF's
  own labels disagree with what is printed. Before changing `cat-harness/scripts/_pdf_headings.py`,
  run `python3 cat-harness/scripts/toc-benchmark.py` before and after: a rule
  that fixes one document and costs two is visible only there. The numbers,
  the methods compared and what could not be run are in
  `cat-harness/docs/research-and-analysis/toc-extraction.md`.

#### For academic papers:
Same as paper-importer Phase 2 — detect theorem/definition/lemma
environments, sections, cross-references.

#### For structured / normative guidelines:

> **Superseded for a `document` folio.** The table below predates the
> `document` content type. Two of its mappings are now wrong there:
> `definition` is a **math** kind whose `lean` field is *required*, so a
> guideline recommendation mapped onto it will not validate at all; and
> `proposition` and `conjecture` are math kinds that `content_profile_check`
> rejects outright. In a document folio, a normative statement is carried by a
> **labelled, titled `prose` block** — load `normative-statements` from the
> `folio-document-adapter` package for the convention and its limits.
>
> The table stands as written for a **paper** folio, which is the case it was
> written for and where all seven kinds are available.

Many guideline and standards documents have a recurring normative
structure that maps onto content-block kinds:

| Guideline element | Content block kind | Notes |
|------------------|-------------------|-------|
| **Recommendation** (numbered, boxed) | `definition` | Normative statement |
| **Evidence / rationale summary** | `prose` | Supporting narrative |
| **Remarks** | `remark` | Implementation notes |
| **Good-practice statement** | `proposition` | Consensus-based |
| **Research priority** | `conjecture` | Open questions |
| **Background** | `prose` | Context sections |
| **Evidence-quality table** | `diagram` | Quality assessment |

When a document distinguishes *normative levels* (e.g. L1 = what to do,
L2 = how to do it), map the normative statement to a `definition` block
and the implementation guidance to a `prose` block tagged with the level
(e.g. `["implementation", "L2"]`). The exact level taxonomy is
domain-specific; record it in the upload's Dublin Core record as `dc.type`
qualified `normativeLevel`.

> Domain-specific guideline handling (e.g. a particular standards body's
> recommendation grammar) belongs in a domain adapter bundle, not the
> generic paper adapter. This skill detects the *shape* and hands off the
> domain-specific mapping rules to the relevant adapter.
>
> That hand-off now has somewhere to go: `folio-document-adapter` is the bundle
> for prose folios, and `normative-statements` is where the recommendation
> grammar belongs.

#### Tables and figures — run `cat-harness/scripts/pdf-tables.py`

Text extraction destroys tables. A GRADE evidence table or a boxed
recommendation comes out of Stage 2 as a run of prose that reads exactly like
prose, and nothing downstream can recover that it was a grid — which matters
most for precisely the guideline documents this skill exists to process.

```bash
python3 cat-harness/scripts/pdf-tables.py FILE.pdf -o uploads/<document-id>/
python3 cat-harness/scripts/pdf-tables.py --check     # which backends are installed
```

Writes `tables.json` (`pdf-tables/v1`) beside `structure.json`, with each
table's cell matrix, column edges, caption, containing `section_id`, and a
**GFM rendering that can be pasted straight into a content block** — the
LaTeX pipeline already converts a GFM table to `\begin{tabular}`.

Tables split across a page break are rejoined when their column geometry
matches; `stitched_from` records what was merged, so check it on any table
whose rows look like two tables.

**Read `status` before you read `tables`.** The three ways to get no tables are
distinguished on purpose, and `tables` is `null` — not `[]` — whenever nothing
actually looked:

| `status` | Exit | Means |
|---|---|---|
| `ok` | 0 | a backend looked; `tables: []` means the document has none |
| `n/a-no-backend` | 5 | `pip install pdfplumber` (or `camelot-py`) |
| `n/a-no-text-layer` | 2 | a scan — its tables are pixels; see Stage 2's OCR route |

Needs `pdfplumber` or `camelot-py`, both pure PyPI installs with no model
weights. **Docling is the better parser and is not this**: its weights come
from HuggingFace, which is 403-blocked in sandboxed sessions, so it is a
workstation/CI stage whose artefacts get committed — the
`docling` capability probe reports it absent here rather than letting a session
believe it ran. See `docs/proposals/rag-document-ingestion.md` §12.26.

**Output**: `extracted-blocks.json` — array of detected blocks with
provisional kinds, titles, and content; `tables.json` for the layout-bearing
parts that do not survive as text.

### Stage 4: Mapping (→ `mapped`)

Interactive step — present extracted blocks to user for review:

1. Show block count by kind
2. Let user rename, reclassify, skip, or merge blocks
3. Let user define chapter/section structure
4. Let user set the target paper ID
5. Generate `mapping.json` with confirmed decisions

### Stage 5: Content Generation (→ `generated`)

Generate content objects under `content/<paper-id>/`:

1. **`.ts` manifests** via `content/schema/builders.ts`
2. **`.md` content** in project markdown conventions
3. **Chapter `.ts` manifests** with section structure
4. **Paper `.ts` manifest** (new or updated)

Tag all generated blocks with:
```typescript
tags: ["imported", "source:<document-id>"]
```

Add `meta.source` referencing the upload:
```typescript
meta: {
  source: "uploads/<document-id>",
  originalSection: "3.2",
  importedAt: "2026-03-25T..."
}
```

## Structured-Document Processing

### Detecting normative structure

Normative guidelines often follow predictable patterns:

```
RECOMMENDATION N:
<recommendation text in bold/box>

Remarks:
- Implementation note 1
- Implementation note 2

Summary of evidence:
<narrative text>

Evidence-quality table:
<quality assessment>
```

### Label conventions for guidelines

| Element | Label pattern | Example |
|---------|--------------|---------|
| Recommendation | `def:<doc>-rec-<N>` | `def:example-rec-1` |
| Evidence summary | `prose:<doc>-evidence-<N>` | — |
| Remark | `rem:<doc>-remark-<N>` | `rem:example-remark-1` |
| Good practice | `prop:<doc>-gps-<N>` | `prop:example-gps-1` |
| Research priority | `conj:<doc>-research-<N>` | `conj:example-research-1` |

### Cross-referencing recommendations

Recommendations often reference each other and external evidence.
Map these to `uses[]` in content objects:

```typescript
export default definition({
  label: "def:example-rec-3",
  title: "Recommendation 3: ...",
  uses: ["def:example-rec-1"],  // references Rec 1
  tags: ["imported", "source:example-doc-2016", "L1", "normative"],
  meta: {
    source: "uploads/example-doc-2016",
    strength: "strong",
    quality: "moderate",
  }
});
```

## Integration with Other Skills

| Skill | Integration point |
|-------|-------------------|
| `paper-importer` | Delegates Phase 5 generation for academic papers |
| `content-validation` | Validates generated content objects |
| `editor` | Reviews generated narrative content |
| `scientific-accuracy` | Checks extracted statements |
| `ontologist` | Maps terminology to glossary |

## Resuming Partial Processing

Where processing stopped is read from what EXISTS, not from a status field.
The old `intake.json` carried `pipeline.stage`, which the adapter wrote once
as `uploaded` and nothing ever advanced — a status nobody maintains reads as
authoritative and is wrong. To resume:

1. `uploaded` — `intake.json` is there
2. `extracted` — `extracted-text.md` (or an extraction record) is there
3. `structured` — `extracted-blocks.json` is there
4. `mapped` — `mapping.json` is there
5. `generated` — blocks tagged `source:<document-id>` exist in the content

Start from the first stage whose artefact is missing.

This allows multi-session processing of large documents.
