# Tabular metadata — CSVW, annotated, and honest about what it could not read

**The model is CSVW and nothing custom.** Bean `ulqj`, decided by the owner:
*"not new/custom thing."* This graph already speaks doco, deo, cito, oa, prov,
skos, dcterms and fhir — eight published vocabularies, zero folio inventions.
`folio-tabular-records/v1` was the one exception and is being retired.

CSVW is a W3C Recommendation, it is already JSON-LD, and it models
**table → column → datatype** and nothing else. That last part is the feature:
*"no full Excel complexity"* is a property of the vocabulary, not a rule anyone
has to remember. CSVW cannot express a formula, a merged cell or a fill colour,
so nobody can add one by accident.

## The one thing CSVW cannot say, and the only place we extend it

**Where the table is.** In CSVW the table *is* the file, so a CSVW document has
no way to say *"this table starts at B7 of sheet 3"*. A real workbook breaks
that assumption three ways:

- a table that does not start at A1,
- a header row that is not row 1,
- several tables on one sheet.

So three `fac:` terms, and **only** these three: `fac:anchor` (sheet, cell, row,
column), `fac:headerRow`, `fac:extent`.

> **The record is JSON; the CSVW is derived from it.** The annotations live in
> `tabular.csvw.json` — plain JSON, deliberately not `.jsonld` — and
> `toCsvw()` in `schemas/tabular-csvw.ts` produces the genuine CSVW metadata
> document from it: the CSVW `@context`, CSVW's own keys, nothing of ours at
> any level. A standard reader is handed that document and gets a correct
> table description. That property is the entire reason for adopting a
> standard rather than inventing a schema, so it is **tested** — the export is
> walked key by key against `CSVW_KEYS` — rather than asserted.

Adding a fourth `fac:` term is the moment to stop and ask whether CSVW really
cannot express it. Usually it can.

### Why JSON and not JSON-LD — bean `792y`

This section used to claim the record WAS a valid CSVW document that a
standard parser would read while ignoring the `fac:` keys. It was not. The
record had no `@context`, so a CSVW parser rejects it, and a JSON-LD processor
keeps only the `fac:` keys, read as IRIs in a URI scheme called `fac`. No
spelling of the prefix fixes that inside CSVW, whose metadata documents may
put only `@language` and `@base` in a local context — see
[`kg-export`](../../../../cat-harness/skills/kg/kg-core/kg-export.md) §"A prefix is the stub".

The owner chose (2026-09-23) between three answers:

| | the record | the cost |
|---|---|---|
| **chosen** | JSON; CSVW DERIVED by `toCsvw()` | the annotations are not linked data |
| full-IRI terms | real CSVW, annotations as ~12 flattened IRI terms, each defined in the vocabulary | JSON-LD drops `null`, so a DETERMINED null — a CSV has no sheet — becomes indistinguishable from "never recorded" |
| our own context | JSON-LD with a context binding our prefix | a CSVW reader still rejects it |

Two facts decided it. **Nothing reads the annotations as linked data** — the
graph projection reads `anchor.sheet` from the JSON — and
[`directory-conventions`](../../../../cat-harness/skills/kg/kg-core/directory-conventions.md) says to generate as many
renderings as have a consumer, and no more. And **the three-state rule below
needs `null` to mean something**, which RDF cannot keep. If a consumer ever
needs placement as linked data, the full-IRI answer is the one to revisit,
and its cost is already written down here.

**The `fac:` in the key names is a JSON name, not a prefix.** It marks our
fields apart from CSVW's in the file. It is safe exactly because the file is
not JSON-LD — rename the file back to `.jsonld` and it dangles again, which
`check:context-emission` would then catch.

## "As best as can" means three states, never two

The owner's phrase, and this repository's oldest rule wearing different
clothes. Every field is **determined**, or **explicitly undetermined with a
reason**. Nothing defaults.

| field | determined when | undetermined looks like |
|---|---|---|
| `datatype` | the column's values classify | `"any"` + `datatypeSource: "undetermined"` |
| `fac:extent` | rows AND columns are both known | both `null` + `source: "undetermined"` |
| `fac:anchor.sheet` | the format has sheets | `null` — a CSV has none, and that is DETERMINED |
| `fac:anchor.cell` | the format has A1 refs | `null` for a CSV |

Two of those nulls are worth separating carefully. **A CSV's `sheet: null` is a
determined answer** — a CSV genuinely has no sheet, and writing `"Sheet1"`
would invent one. An `undetermined` extent is the opposite: we looked and could
not tell. The schema enforces the difference; `source` is what tells them
apart, and a half-known extent is refused outright because it reads as a
measurement.

**Never guess a datatype to avoid an `undetermined`.** A column of `1, 2, 3,
N/A` is not an integer column. `any` with a recorded reason is a better answer
than `integer` with a silent coercion, because the second one is indis-
tinguishable from a correct reading.

## Generic workflow, format-specific tools

The *process* does not change between formats; *reading the bytes* does.

```
sniff → route → extract → annotate → validate
```

One workflow. One tool per format — `tabular-csv`, `tabular-xlsx` — each
declared in `tools/index.ts` and naming this skill in `satisfies`. A CSV has one
table and no cells outside it; a workbook has sheets, possibly several tables
per sheet, and a table that may start anywhere. That difference lives in the
tool, never in the workflow and never in the schema.

Routing a CSV is **not** a sniff: a CSV has no magic bytes, and bean `p67i`
established that it must not become an extension guess either. The content
question is the only one available — do the first rows split into the same
number of fields, more than one?

## What a sheet IS in the graph — model reality, do not force conformance

The owner, 2026-09-20, asked to choose between *sheet as a `table` block* and
*sheet as a grouping node*: **"both, sheet in grouping and single sheet. should
model reality. not force conformance."**

So the shape follows the SOURCE:

| source | graph |
|---|---|
| multi-sheet workbook | `manifest.contains → sheet → table block(s)` |
| single-sheet CSV | `manifest.contains → table block` |

**This was already decided one level down.** `fac:anchor.sheet` is `null` for a
CSV because *a CSV genuinely has no sheet, and writing `"Sheet1"` would invent
one*. Wrapping a CSV in a sheet node invents the same sheet; flattening a
workbook discards a real one. Both uniform options were a choice of which lie
to tell consistently.

It is also why `fac:anchor` exists: a table may not start at A1 and a sheet may
hold more than one. A graph that cannot express *sheet contains tables*
contradicts a constraint the schema already carries.

**Special-casing common scenarios is explicitly fine** (the owner, same turn).
The instinct when two shapes exist is to find the abstraction covering both — a
`depth` parameter, a container that is sometimes elided, a walker that handles
N levels. That instinct produces a model nobody can read. Two legible branches
beat one clever one, and a third source type gets a third branch; unifying them
is a measurement to take later, not a prediction to make now.

The limit: **a special case must still be a special case of something TRUE.**
Flattening a workbook because single-sheet is the common case would not be
special-casing, it would be forced conformance wearing the licence as cover.

## A stub must be impossible to mistake for a result

No extractor ships today (the owner: *"no tooling needed, stub out, make QA to
catch absence"*). A tool that has not been built records `fac:stub` with the
tool's name, a reason, and a **date** — undated, a stub cannot be told from
abandoned work, which is the same argument `bean-blocking` makes for an expiry.

Three rules, each one paid for:

1. **A stub is never `met`.** It is `not-derivable`, naming the tool. A stub
   that reports success is worse than no tool at all.
2. **A half-stub is refused.** `fac:stub` alongside non-empty `columns` fails
   schema validation, because a thin-but-present extraction reads as a working
   one. This is the `6xaz` shape: sheet names right, headers empty, output
   looking like a workbook that simply had no headers.
3. **A stub expires.** When the real tool lands, `fac:stub` must go. `bun run
   check:tabular-stubs` fails CI when a record carries both a stub and real
   columns, and reports every outstanding stub on every run.

Rule 3 is the one that rots if nobody writes it down. This session fixed the
same defect four times — a restated list, a reason in a YAML comment, a
backlog keyed to the wrong thing, a third state with no expiry — and then
introduced a fifth: a probe that looked for `transcript.json` when the arm
writes `transcript/`, so the ratchet could never have fired. **A declared
exception must carry something a test can re-derive.**

## What this skill does not cover

- **The narrative** — what a dataset is *about*. That needs an author; bean
  `p67i` stopped there deliberately, and the headers being right there is
  exactly why assembling one from them would be fabrication.
- **Migrating `folio-tabular-records/v1`.** Bean `eief` carries it.
- **Emitting the manifest.** Done — `content/pipeline/tabular-nodes.ts` builds
  the nodes and `gen-library-jsonld.ts` calls it from `buildEntryNodes`. What
  the wiring cost is worth knowing, because all three defects were invisible
  while nothing called the emitter: the nodes carried no `@context`;
  `orphanedBlocks` scanned `sections/` alone, so every table block of a
  tabular entry read as orphaned and `--prune` would have deleted them; and a
  fully-ingested tabular entry was reported *"no structure.json — not
  ingested"*. **A tested function nothing calls is not a tested function.**
