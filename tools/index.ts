/**
 * folio-assistant-core's Tool nodes — the `tools` graph for the content layer.
 *
 * @module folio-assistant-core/tools
 * @graphNode tool
 *
 * Reached by the harness through tool auto-discovery (`cat-harness/tools/
 * discover.ts`, bean `p0za`), never by an import: the harness may not import
 * core (`check:partition`), and a Tool node is a declaration read at load.
 *
 * ## `folio-changeset` — bean `jwox`, epic `q4jm`
 *
 * The ChangeSet is content vocabulary (what changed in a folio, block by
 * block), so its schema and computation live in `schemas/changeset.ts`, and
 * the Tool that exposes it lives here beside them rather than in the harness.
 * It is invoked as a shell command, so declaring it copies no code.
 *
 * ## `dublin-core-render` — bean `7eak`
 *
 * Dublin Core is content vocabulary (`schemas/dublin-core.ts`), and the
 * harness may not import it, so the renderer and its Tool live here. The
 * owner asked for it *"in rendering ppiple as skill and tool"*.
 *
 * ## `folio-review-comments` — bean `423d`, epic `q4jm`
 *
 * A pull request's tagged conversation comments, ingested into
 * `review-comment/1.0.0` todos and written as `review-comments.json`. A
 * Tool, and governed by the `review-comments` skill, on the owner's ruling
 * *"make sure it is a Skill/Tool so process can be modified later"*: the
 * staging workflow only calls it.
 *
 * ## `block-actions` — bean `uphx`, REQ-17
 *
 * [edit] and [feedback] on every block of a document: the owner asked for it
 * as common core functionality (2026-10-06), so the document build draws the
 * links and this Tool hands them to an agent.

    // 2026-09-20: nothing in the corpus WRITES a `VerificationEntry`.
